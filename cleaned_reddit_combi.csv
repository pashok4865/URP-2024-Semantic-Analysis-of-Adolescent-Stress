School during Covid sucks,"I swear my teachers don’t even care about any of their students. We just had midterms this week and it was fucking hell. I studied all week, barely slept and ate, and I’m just so tired of it all. Not to mention we have psats in a day and none of the teachers or even my parents said anything to me. I have extracurriculars that take time and I don’t know how to do anything right anymore. I’m just tired and stressed all the time and it’s in a cycle that just keeps going. I’m only in highschool and I already feel like my life is falling apart. I can’t seem to focus and I can’t seem to get anything done on time. I’ve lost all motivation to do school work. I used to love school and seeing my friends and now I’d rather fucking kill myself than deal with this anymore. But then I feel bad because I know there’s people with a lot worse problems than me so I’m sorry if I made anyone feel annoyed that was not my intention. I’m just tired and I need to get all this tension out.","School during Covid sucks I swear my teachers don’t even care about any of their students.

Too Stressed To Do Anything,"I wrapping up my sophomore year of high school, and I have so many final projects to do, exams to study for, and just stuff in general to worry about. Problem is, I have so many things to do, and they all stress me out so much that I can't bring myself to do any of them. Every time I sit down to write an essay or whatnot, I just end up too emotionally tired to do it. I cannot open my laptop without feeling almost physically exhausted and ill. Does anyone have any ideas for combatting this, or any ways to push past it?","Too Stressed To Do Anything I wrapping up my sophomore year of high school, and I have so many final projects to do, exams to study for, and just stuff in general to worry about.

College Student,"So I started off intending to pursue something else in college, I spent the past two years and had taken 32 credits geared to what I thought I originally wanted to do. Im Turing 21 in a couple of months and now just had a realization that no this is not what I want to pursue, so I applied to switch my major. Thankfully, the 32 credits can be applied towards the degree. However, Im turning 21 I feel like others around me have accomplished so much, and completing their degrees. Its just so overwhelming, and I feel like now my whole life timeline has been completely thrown off. Im back at square one with 4 years of college to go.

I want to get help,"Hello my name is Pryscilla, I’m 20. I should be very happy. Just a quick run-down I go to college, I work, I have an amazing boyfriend, and I have friends. Lately keeping up with all this has gotten harder. Throughout my life it has been a series of crazy events and most of my life has been me going through depression even in my childhood years. I didn’t grow up in a healthy environment, I lost the person who helped raise me and who I saw everyday, am sleeping in his room, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship my high school to college years and now I should be happy. I was content before but I don’t know what happened. I talk to my boyfriend about it and I smoke weed all the time, I’ve grown addicted. I smoke to escape reality. I feel terrible. I feel like a terrible person and I get mood swings all the time. My boyfriend absolutely loves me and he urges me to get therapy and I want to. Especially because I want this relationship to work but most of all I just want to be happy for once. I am constantly negative and overthinking and I cry a lot, some days I feel like a different person. I want to seek therapy but I don’t have money, I’m broke. I’m not asking for anything but I don’t know where to go. I ask my mom to help me find therapy and she doesn’t take me seriously, even though years ago I had a suicide attempt and she dragged me to a therapist in which I denied help. But now I want it. What are the first steps to finding a good psychologist, how do I know what type to look for, how do I get a diagnosis, and does the fact that I have insurance help? Thank you.","I want to get help Hello my name is Pryscilla, I’m 20. I should be very happy. Just a quick run-down I go to college, I work, I have an amazing boyfriend, and I have friends.

Worst night yet (long rant),"I'm 15 right now, school is becoming so hard, I've got to the point where I'm so stressed that I just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it. For the next 3 weeks, I've got a big important test each day. They're not even exams, just big tests. I told myself that I would start studying yesterday i came home, opened my agenda and started crying, it was big, ungly, loud sobs. I'm so stressed, I basically had a mental breakdown over school, and this isnt even the hardest year. One of the only ways I deal w stress is cutting myself, so that occupied me for a while. People always say put ur mental health before school work, but for me, a lazy perfectionist, that makes my mental health worse. I'm so tired because by the time I've finished crying about how much work I have, I'm completely drained and I fall asleep. I then wake up when my parents come home so 8PM, have dinner and then start my school work. I'm usually still up at 1-2 AM. Then I wake up at 7 and start again. AND MY TEACHERS THEN GIVE US MORE FUCKING WORK CUZ U KNOW, 1 MENTAL BREAKDOWN A WEEK ISNT ENOUGH!!!! I cant fucking deal w this anymore but if I give up on school then I'll be even more stressed if such a thing is possible","Worst night yet (long rant) I'm 15 right now, school is becoming so hard, I've got to the point where I'm so stressed that I just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it.

Could 1 person just read this - it's getting harder to pretend I'm okay and I dont know how to keep it up,"EDIT Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can. Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3 I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth. My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves. It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together. School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time. I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat. Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.","Could 1 person just read this - it's getting harder to pretend I'm okay and I dont know how to keep it up EDIT Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can.

cancelled on me last minute or during class when we cant use our phones or just simply not been there my mental health doesnt fucking matter to the school does it they say its really important we look after our wellbeing so they suggest going out for a walk breathing taking breaths and talking to someone well we already know thats not fucking possible but the other tips are just really basic level things they dont bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists they only tell us how to look after our wellbeing when im doing all those things and its gone beyond that im really doing badly and they dont care they just expect you to get on with it so i get told off for

Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now.,"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. {My thoughts on my father} {{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}} {my thoughts on my brother} {{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5 30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother. Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset. (A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}} This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. {my thoughts on my mother} {{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history (Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. ) And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}} {thoughts on my own disgusting self} It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me. I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.","Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now. Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. {My thoughts on my father} {{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}} {my thoughts on my brother} {{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5 30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother. Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset. (A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}} This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. {my thoughts on my mother} {{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history (Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. ) And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}} {thoughts on my own disgusting self} It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me. I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",1,,im begging somebody to read this i desperately need to feel like i have a friend there for me right now posting this on a few subs because i dont know what to do i feel like ive reached my breaking point im so tired im so tired of existing im so tired of being mad im so tired of being tired its pathetic im a year old adult whos stuck living at home with my family i can feel myself falling apart and im reaching the point where im finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life or im going to end up cutting ties all together with my family which is where ill probably sink if its sink or swim out in the big world i am holding on to so many grudges from so many years that i clearly cant cope with in a healthy way my heart hurts so much but im such a glutton for punishment that i cant bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate and it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive ill try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since i doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through my thoughts on my father as an adult now i realize that i spent probably the first years of my life living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father i still remember being years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom was a big steroid fan back in the day i spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because i frequently got cs in school which my parents would ground us for even one c on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester i still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework not even so much for not doing my homework but it was distinctly about lying about it my father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall and i remember my mother saying well dont choke him insert name and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying im not choking him i still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified i was that the gameboy sp i was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because i was certain i was going to get beat again i remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it that i was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black i remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting was obviously my last time doing it too when my dad came to pick me up he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them but you know now that im an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality if im going to get my ass beat im going to get my ass beat im just not living in fear anymore my thoughts on my brother which brings me to my brother who as of lately might as well be dead to me we have not currently spoken since april and as far as im concerned we probably wont ever speak again lets start with me saying i feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start me bailing him out when he needs it i remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work because it was my job to

to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until youre this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school which is back when it was highly frowned upon and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school my dumb ass bailing him out again until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch and he came back with a hotboxed car and didnt air it out so when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke my brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch my brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving i dont remember which being on the streets on his own he was arrested

think my senior year of high school my parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge i remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour hes in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend because he was literally hitting either her or her andor her kid and i remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse isnt this okay because its what dad used to do to us of course having a criminal record he couldnt find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for this job is an hour gets benefit and vacation days i on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs two years ago i worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave my dumb ass stayed thinking well now that shes gone itll look better on me which is when they brought in another outside hire who i was eventually cool with i just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay until i finally got so fed up that i transferred to gamestop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since i already had basic management training so two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because its not full time and at your age your brother worked full time at my age yall gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal anything i do its just never going to be good enough let me talk about our most recent altercation because its a fantastic transition into my mother as of last april i was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak and of course that sets off my family members because i sleep all day while they work so my mother asked me on april th the day before my birthday a day that i was operating on approximately hours of sleep because im always up all night if i could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it i have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time it was so bad that they sent me home early so being there in general makes me uncomfortable even when i go in to help my dads department so of course i didnt want to help which wasnt an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the th time of her saying something obviously i snapped and agreed to which she responded forget it and slammed my door shut it should be noted that in my mothers defense im a nightmare to wake up because of how little i sleep there are times i wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and i was nasty meanwhile i have literally no recollection of even speaking to her so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days i woke up that morning still mad about the fight i had with my mother the day prior because i feel like as a grown ass adult i should be allowed to say no i dont want to do something get to the warehouse work the shift i leave at five which apparently was a mistake because i wasnt supposed to leave until which i thought was fine because i genuinely thought they left at every day and i didnt take a lunch break because i was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave obviously that was wrong and i got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after i had left i stopped by aunts house to vent because i was literally seeing red wasnt even planning on going home for my birthday because i just didnt want to be around any of them the next day comes and i dont show up because not only did i not want to be there but when i had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said we dont know if well need you tomorrow or not yet so i just didnt bother to show up because if yall needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion so of course my petty ass isnt going to show up my brother comes home through the door doesnt even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up why should i have to explain to my boss why you didnt come why do you get to sleep all day while we work im sick of it turning to my mother im sick of him arent yall sick of him to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down but i wont ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me and of course im running my mouth back in return which is when he decided to put his hands on me shoving me literally to the floor and this is about where i black out with anger because i had my nintendo switch in my hand the limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that so obviously im pissed and yank his playstation out of the wall and slam it on the ground you can skip the next parentheses part if you dont care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset a detour to mention about these video game consoles my brother and i used to exclusively use xbox but i made the transition to the ps when it came out my brother didnt i had been asking for a playstation since they came out for both my birthday and christmas for i think like two years until the year my brother spent christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka when my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean he got a playstation when i asked why he got one and i didnt despite it literally being the only thing i asked for as a christmas gift she said well he wasnt here for christmas so i had to make it special i think i eventually got the playstation for my birthday the following year but this fucking switch man i swore up and down when i was a gamestop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and im lowkey heartbroken that i just spent a majority of my money on the standard one i eventually get myself so worked up over it that i asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system and i will give her when i sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck shes talking some i cant i dont have that kind of money which would have been totally fine i was just embarrassed that i not only put my pride away to ask for money but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation so whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if i sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest where as i was only asking her for the front because i didnt want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all especially since i had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan so obviously im super thankful to my mom and i literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it only for me to find out that she had given me my own money i dont know what it was for possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare and at that point all i can keep thinking is wow you really kept my own money from me made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder and told me you couldnt loan me anything that makes me so mad how are you going to lie about my own damn money serves me right i guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account anyway i slam his playstation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which i say something along the lines of youre allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your playstation to which he responds talking out of his ass well you didnt pay for it mom did jokes on you asshole not only did i pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console this ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family myself included has to have the last word in argument which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since theres not a gaming system in my hand i pull his disgusting ass down with me this whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother my thoughts on my mother fun fact maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol because they had a friend in critical condition from covid this is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic im in florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because floridians are trash so i spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own spending what little money i had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand one thing leads to another and i eventually end up back home i asked my mom if we could start family therapy because im literally holding onto grudges that i dont know how to let go of she says when all of this is over but im positive shes forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together a few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her carim exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all so i get right up get dressed grab my keys and when i walk out of my room she goes are you ready now im not in a rush or anything i was a little annoyed by the stupid question ill admit like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you yes im ready to go lol otherwise id still be asleep she of course takes my flat response a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion as me being in a bad mood so we get into my car and shes overreacting because my car is a little shaky which im almost positive is just because i need air in my tires talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire its been doing this since like the second week i got this car so im just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of youre in a bad mood because i asked you to take me my response being oh what im in a bad mood because i got right up to do something you asked me to do which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car i dont understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something she did it to me on my birthday too which i forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in but like it drives me crazy i dont care if theyre right wrong or somewhere in between nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person so when i sit there and tell you im not mad and you tell me yes you are mad thats why youre being shitty thats a self fulfilling prophecy right there of course that shits going to make me mad if youre just going to decide im in a bad mood for me then shit i guess im in a bad fucking mood then so this screaming match in my car leads to her saying i hope something happens to your car and when it does dont call me i will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me i hope that when something does happen to my car im inside of it i hope its something fatal and i hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life and then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit talking some i wont be screamed at in a car that i bought you you are so disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live as if she didnt kick me out when i was and and like clearly i can manage in my car bitch try me i would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like i need help from someone who treats me like shit skip the parentheses if you dont care about context with my car history both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our th birthday the difference between us is my brother has wrecked i think cars my parents bought him one car they gave him because my mom got a new car which that one he wasnt at fault for but still its a car to add to your tally and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day i on the other hand drove the same car that i had since i was until literally this year when i turned and was given a new one but honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years i just fought them on it because i didnt want a new car which i will explain why later and then now just today we are in another arguement because i think last night my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks hes cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isnt literally crying mommy bail me out when hes in there as hes going out he knocks over the ashtray i had been using over there which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night i was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and i had all my technology on me but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me your ashtray is knocked over as if i wasnt outside and heard him kick it over like im supposed to lean up after him despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since april so i hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of if he needs an ashtray hell have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess which of course infuriated me and then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it well it is your ashtray okay did i kick over my ashtray or did my brother because thats the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over in regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most because i often at times feels like shes the only one out of the of my immediately family that i could have a relationship with or that i actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips i dont want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond ive been spoiled sure but my problem with it is i feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head i fought her for years about getting a new because i knew she would just hold it over my head which obviously i was right about i remember being kicked out when i was because i wasnt working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live so i did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family spent a year or two there and i literally did not get my car back the same one she had given me at until the girl i was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery literal brain surgery was the only reason i got my car back and it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother my father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with i can admit that the problem with it is that because i dont feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that i do about my mother i dont really care about him favoring me and because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more which in turn causes me to always just feel like im chasing my mothers approval or some shit thoughts on my own disgusting self its only been recently that im starting to come around to my father and thats only because i think im starting to hate my mother i know i probably sound ungrateful and entitled and i can see why but i am truly thankful for how privilege ive been and all that ive been given but i dont know how to not feel the way that i feel about these things and thats not to say im perfect either ive caused plenty of problem for my family so let me just skip to all my flaws now when i was a kid like before i could even start kindergarten i was literally already sucking dick my next door neighbor my brothers age at the time used to make me do it to him and i used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when i do would so he was already a problem child too but thats neither here nor there i was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when i would hang out with him and his friends and the neighbor always let me hang around for obvious reasons distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but i guess nothing was ever done about it not even sure if my parents know about it but as an adult i can see thats where i started getting fucked up idk if i necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay because i do firmly as a gay man believe that its just who you are and cant be changed but i feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it like what if i wasnt sucking dick at five years old would i be interested in girls i remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met what i now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush like looking back on my child hood i vividly remember playing doctor with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and i realize like damn thats fucking gross we were all kids fast forward to me being in i think middle school and i was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin i was definitely old enough to know better so i take fault there but i also wasnt ever the one initiating it you know i was letting him suck me off for longer than i can remember honestly but i also distinctly remember i wasnt the one initiating it i still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that i dont remember when i started letting him do stuff to me but i know that i shouldnt have i remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times i would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in i remember one time i was up late and he comes walking out like hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him but again i was the older kid in that situation so thats my fuck up obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family i can see why but in hindsight i always wonder would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me and i can see why again i should have known better thats probably around the time i started getting fat by high school at one point i was over pounds and openly gay never had a serious relationship never even had someone interested in a relationship with me i can see why not only was i cringey in high school but i was literally disgusting it wasnt till about my senior year i finally got back under pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence but heres the kicker before i started losing the weight i had become a literal serial catfisher and im talking like anybody you wanted to see naked i would go out of my way to target friends friends boyfriends nobody was off limits to me it makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people ive catfished because i was horny and lonely catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college granted i was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasnt me despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to the college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that which is when they were like wow we were wrong were so sorry dont even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though it wasnt only until i hit maybe or that it like clicked with how awful what i was doing was and started making an active effort to stop it and i feel like i was only even willing to because i fell in genuine love with somebody i was catfishing when i finally told him we were fine for a few days he told me he didnt care that i was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen but all of that quickly crumbled to ashes thats another one thats my own fault not only was i doing something shitty but i was also in too deep i think i still to this day get texted from somebody i started catfishing when i was about or that i just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to but since the recent heart break ive thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy i was in too deep with and the old catfish accounts that i occasionally log into when im desperately alonehornywhatever it may be im tired of feeling alone i just want to be loved i want someone to want me to care about me im starting to realize this world is awful almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak some people genuinely want to live long happy lives me personally i dont think i can make it doing this shit for another years self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons because i feel like if i dont turn them into jokes ill let them overcome me too many people in this world are awful i dont want to be one anymore i doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through but if you for some unknown reason did then i thank you because i could really use a friend tldr im a scumbag im starting to think my family is scumbags and im genuinely losing my will to live ive been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach i dont know how much longer i can do this but god i would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus

How do I deal with this,"Hello I'm a 19 year old (f), english is not my first language so sorry for my spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm suffering from burn-out symptoms and have a fear of failing (idk is this has a name), especially when it comes to school. I am currently only doing 2 subjects, maths and chemistry, so that next year I can go to university. Its been almost 2 years since I started having burn-out/stress symptoms. I cry alot, get stressed by tiny things. So when I make a mistake in my calculations in maths or something, it is possible for my to start crying and have a semi-panick attack. I am seeing a psychologist so I am getting some help. But at home it is different, I still live with my parents and lil sister. My mum tries to help by saying, ""oh its only two subjects no need to worry, dont be so stressed"" and other quotes like that, my dad does the same. But this is only making my fears and stress worse, it makes me feel like I am being silly for feeling like this and not good enough for these subjects. When I tried talking to my mum about it she told me that she cant help it if I am interpretatting it negatively and that I shouldnt think like that and she got a bit mad. I just said ""okey"" as I didnt know what to do and felt now worse than before. My stress has gotten so bad now that sometimes I have a semi-panick attack over minor things, like talking to strangers, when my parents tell me to do something, small changes in my schedule etc. Now we (me and my family) are going on vacation soon and I'm getting really stressed about it because my tests are really short after and when I try to tell my parents how stressed I am they just start again with the oh its only two subjects thing and get a little mad when I say I dont want to go with them. All this has brought some tension between me and my parents and I really dont know how to talk with them about this anymore. Everytime I start thinking about it I start crying and all that. Do any of you have some advise for me? Sorry for the long story, sorry if its written a bit hasty. I'm trying to do homework but keep having small panick attacks.","How do I deal with this Hello I'm a 19 year old (f), english is not my first language so sorry for my spelling and grammar mistakes.

I don't enjoy being... human,"Also I'm not intrested in jumping into the void (death) either. I'm scared of non-existence. I want to live or... I just want to exist. Observe. Not participating in the world, just watching people from ghost-like perspective. I don't like doing stuff. I just want to watch, or swim in the ocean of warmth untill I'll get better. I'm poor, always have been, no rich parents. My parents are poor and abusive. Never went to college, but it's not a big deal for anyone (I hate myself for that, but I've been too depressed to study anything, also I failed my finals and I only have hs degree). I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 12. I'm 22 now. I had a really f up childhood and adolescence, so much traumatic experience, I can't even count them all. Extreme poverty, loneliness, lack of friends etc. Six years spent in theraphy for nothing, at least we've got free healthcare, lol. Talking about obvious things is not for me I guess. I was a patient on a mental ward also - no one could help me. Meds - same, and I've tried too many. I just don't like being human, it's not for me. And there is no escape from it. There is death or... this life. For me, the only way to stop being poor is to work my ass off at some low-income job and saving some money. And then what? Considering, that I don't even have power to work so much. I'm not from US, I know that things are different there. I'm too exhausted to work and I don't see the point. I even skipped work today first time in months. I dont' have the power to educate myself anymore. You see, human life is... boring. And these parts of life that are considered not boring are really expensive or not that cool after all. I'm intrested in supernatural (even tho I don't believe in this kind of stuff) since I was a child because being human truly sucks. Working, working, working. Eating, fucked up boring activities, working, mundane job. And even these things that I like... I don't see the point in doing them. I used to like writing in my native language, but right now my head is like made of cement. Brain fog, being exhausted, lack of imagination. Years of stress and anxiety gave me a brain damage. Damn, I don't know even how to write this stuff without mistakes, even tho I understand English perfectly. I have no plans for my life, I won't ever get a degree, in my country if you're not working as an IT expert or a private doctor or a lawyer you earn nothing. I've got OCD, depression and various anxiety-related stuff. In my country there is a cult of working your ass off. If you're not doing it, then you're a loser and a lazy mother\*\*\*\*r and you deserve nothing. Also, you're poor. Everything I like, even when I was a child, from music to movies, is about supernatural. About hazy dream state or abstract or surreal stuff. Demonic possesions, vampires, being trapped in a dream, dying and hallucinating - some of my favourite movies. I don't like life. I don't like being human. And I guess I'll never like it. No one will help me, I can only count on myself - and I'm too tired to do that. My body is failing, my back is twisted, I look like shit. I can't fix my skeleton. I hate my face. I hate human life, I don't enjoy human activites, even pleasant ones. I know it's depression, but it's also something deeper. Since I was born I felt that something is wrong, that I shouldn't be alive. That I shouldn't be human. If there is life after death, I'm gonna be so proud of myself that I survived (even tho I died, lol). I don't have plans for my life, because I'm broke, alone and without future. There is no future for someone who doesn't work, work, work, work That's reallity. So, I'm just gonna exist a bit longer, and then who knows? Climate change? Suicide? War? Nothing? Just same ol' bs? I'm so lonely. I've got my bf, but he... He's not really into helping me, he's got his own problems and traumas. I'm trapped. I don't want to die. I don't want to live. Theraphy is not working, never worked for me I KNOW why I feel like that, meds are not working, my reallity is crushing me. It's all so boring, so... sad. It's not just how my life works, any other scenarios are completely impossible or just not exciting at all. I just hate being human.

I've got OCD, depression and various anxiety-related stuff. In my country there is a cult of working your ass off. If you're not doing it, then you're a loser and a lazy mother\*\*\*\*r and you deserve nothing. Also, you're poor. Everything I like, even when I was a child, from music to movies, is about supernatural. About hazy dream state or abstract or surreal stuff. Demonic possesions, vampires, being trapped in a dream, dying and hallucinating - some of my favourite movies. I don't like life. I don't like being human. And I guess I'll never like it. No one will help me, I can only count on myself - and I'm too tired to do that. My body is failing, my back is twisted, I look like shit. I can't fix my skeleton. I hate my face. I hate human life, I don't enjoy human activites, even pleasant ones. I know it's depression, but it's also something deeper. Since I was born I felt that something is wrong, that I shouldn't be alive. That I shouldn't be human. If there is life after death, I'm gonna be so proud of myself that I survived (even tho I died, lol). I don't have plans for my life, because I'm broke, alone and without future. There is no future for someone who doesn't work, work, work, work That's reallity. So, I'm just gonna exist a bit longer, and then who knows? Climate change? Suicide? War? Nothing? Just same ol' bs? I'm so lonely. I've got my bf, but he... He's not really into helping me, he's got his own problems and traumas. I'm trapped. I don't want to die. I don't want to live. Theraphy is not working, never worked for me I KNOW why I feel like that, meds are not working, my reallity is crushing me. It's all so boring, so... sad. It's not just how my life works, any other scenarios are completely impossible or just not exciting at all. I just hate being human. Sorry for my English, blah blah, I hope you'll understand everything.",1,,i dont enjoy being human also im not intrested in jumping into the void death either im scared of nonexistence i want to live or i just want to exist observe not participating in the world just watching people from ghostlike perspective i dont like doing stuff i just want to watch or swim in the ocean of warmth untill ill get better im poor always have been no rich parents my parents are poor and abusive never went to college but its not a big deal for anyone i hate myself for that but ive been too depressed to study anything also i failed my finals and i only have hs degree ive been struggling with anxiety and depression since i was im now i had a really f up childhood and adolescence so much traumatic experience i cant even count them all extreme poverty loneliness lack of friends etc six years spent in theraphy for nothing at least weve got free healthcare lol talking about obvious things is not for me i guess i was a patient on a mental ward also no one could help me meds same and ive tried too many i just dont like being human its not for me and there is no escape from it there is death or this life for me the only way to stop being poor is to work my ass off at some lowincome job and saving some money and then what considering that i dont even have power to work so much im not from us i know that things are different there im too exhausted to work and i dont see the point i even skipped work today first time in months i dont have the power to educate myself anymore you see human life is boring and these parts of life that are considered not boring are really expensive or not that cool after all im intrested in supernatural even tho i dont believe in this kind of stuff since i was a child because being human truly sucks working working working eating fucked up boring activities working mundane job and even these things that i like i dont see the point in doing them i used to like writing in my native language but right now my head is like made of cement brain fog being exhausted lack of imagination years of stress and anxiety gave me a brain damage damn i dont know even how to write this stuff without mistakes even tho i understand english perfectly i have no plans for my life i wont ever get a degree in my country if youre not working as an it expert or a private doctor or a lawyer you earn nothing ive got ocd depression and various anxietyrelated stuff in my country there is a cult of working your ass off if youre not doing it then youre a loser and a lazy motherr and you deserve nothing also youre poor everything i like even when i was a child from music to movies is about supernatural about hazy dream state or abstract or surreal stuff demonic possesions vampires being trapped in a dream dying and hallucinating some of my favourite movies i dont like life i dont like being human and i guess ill never like it no one will help me i can only count on myself and im too tired to do that my body is failing my back is twisted i look like shit i cant fix my skeleton i hate my face i hate human life i dont enjoy human activites even pleasant ones i know its depression but its also something deeper since i was born i felt that something is wrong that i shouldnt be alive that i shouldnt be human if there is life after death im gonna be so proud of myself that i survived even tho i died lol i dont have plans for my life because im broke alone and without future there is no future for someone who doesnt work work work work thats reallity so im just gonna exist a bit longer and then who knows climate change suicide war nothing just same ol bs im so lonely ive got my bf but he hes not really into helping me hes got his own problems and traumas im trapped i dont want to die i dont want to live theraphy is not working never worked for me i know why i feel like that meds are not working my reallity is crushing me its all so boring so sad its not just how my life works any other scenarios are completely impossible or just not exciting at all i just hate being human sorry for my english blah blah i hope youll understand everything,0.5,"stress, anxiety, depression, exhausted, tired","college, study",none,"lit, bet",5,2,0,2

It was a black and grey figure, bright grey eyes, its arms thin with sharp claws, and missing legs that had purple mist grow from where they should have been. It appeared more frequently every passing day. I told people about it, but nobody wished to believe me. When I told people, they responded with ""*Well, does this 'thing' have a name? If its so real, it must have one.*"" Sadly, I didn't know its name, but one day I built the courage to ask it. I met it in a forest by my house, in private, I asked for its name and why it was always following me. He came close to me and spoke to me. ""*I go by many names,* ***Sadness, Despair, Depression.*** *But in your case, call me...****Autism****.""* Autism said he was connected to me since birth, an accidental life. Back then, I thought he was just a person nobody understood like me, so I let him stay with me. But now, Autism has almost ruined my life. He began forcing me to be different. Separating me from people I cared about and those who cared for me. I didn't believe I could save myself from him. He always held me close, trapped me in strings with hooks that dug into my bones. He used them whenever he wished, and made me a puppet. Whenever he took me over I became ***Aggressive, Harmful, Dangerous.*** I always begged him to leave me alone, but he just laughed and reminded me that we were stuck together. One day, I had had enough. I finally faced the shadow that took me over, and I ***reconciled*** with it. I knew it wouldn't leave, even if I told it to. I asked for it to try and change, to listen to me, to help me become unique, to help me be normal, not a monster, ***to make me a person.*** He stared back at me, and apologized to everything he had done, he had just wanted me to act his way. We spoke until we finally reached an agreement. I had thought my life was turning around. I was making friends, Becoming active, succeeding in school. Although he would return to his habits sometimes, he kept his word and had become a friend of my own. When I introduced people to him some weren't impressed, but most liked him and thought he was interesting. It was working out...until now... I had believed 2020 would be the worst year of my life, because of the events the world is facing. But it ended up being the following year, 2021. My Mother had not been in the greatest of conditions. She was stuck in the hospital due to a mass in her stomach and fluids filling her insides. She was getting better every day, to a point where we could take her back home. (She stayed on a hospital bed at the house though.) I was going to high school one day, when my step dad told me he had the Virus. We lived about 6 streets away from out grandparents, so me and my brother went to live with them until he got better, taking care of my Mother who was still at the house. My Grandparents told me we were going back to check on them, Autism was really nervous about what would happen, but I ignored him. We got there and we said hello to them. Then our stepdad told us the worst news ever, our mom would pass away in the next two days to a week. I was fully aware this was an opportunity to happen, I was already prepared for this, my brother wasn't as much. So today was the day we would say goodbye to her. I won't go into much detail about here, but when we left back to our Grandparents house. I went upstairs and saw Autism sitting on the bed, Sad. I tried to comfort him. Every time I was about to cry, he would tell me ""Crying will not help, its hard to keep the sadness in, but do not shed tears for anybody in front of anybody. It will only make it worse."" These events on my Mom have happened a few days ago, and is about to pass away.

My 3 month hiatus after a mental breakdown is about to end,"I've always been depressed/anxious for as long as I can remember, but this past year, my mental health has been at a severe all time low. I quit my really great job 3 months ago because I had a mental breakdown and literally felt like I was going crazy and couldn't handle anything at all. I've always been work motivated and have never not had a job since I was a teenager (I'm 30 now.) The last 3 months have been incredibly difficult to say the least. I've been seeing a therapist and I've tried 9 different antidepressants/antipsychotics in the last like 6 months. Nothing has helped. I sleep most of the day every day. I haven't needed hospitization thankfully, however my husband and I have definitely discussed the possibility of me needing to be admitted and there have been times that I was very close to going. I've had to have him hide my propanolol (I take as needed for panic attacks/anxiety) because I was suicidal and fantasizing about overdosing. I just started Trintellix (in addition to Lamictal) about 2 weeks ago. For the first week or two of taking most of the medications I've tried, it has always seemed to help at least a little bit. I'm assuming that's just a placebo effect because I want it to help so badly. But they always stop helping and I go back to my bedridden, severely depressed self. The last week or so, I've actually felt better than I have in the last few months. I'm not 100% of course and I still have a hard time getting myself motivated to do shit, but I actually feel like there is a possibility of me being able to get things done. I feel like there is a 150 lb weight on top of me instead of a 200 lb weight on top of me. I'm really, REALLY scared it's not going to last like all the rest of the medications though. Long story short, I finally got a job. A good one that I'm excited about. I start in 20 days. I'm looking back at the last few months and looking at how I'm feeling now. I really really want to start this job while feeling at least okay. I know that once the excitement of the job passes, the depression will probably creep back up, but I'm hoping it'll be at least manageable. I don't want to fuck it up and have to stop working again. I'm trying to think of ways I can prepare mentally before I start- what kind of habits I should try to start getting into ahead of time so I don't find myself too overwhelmed and unable to handle anything. I've been so severely depressed the last 3 months and I'm not going to be able to stay in bed all day when I start this job. It's going to be exhausting if I don't make changes now.

I’m super nervous and anxious about starting in a brand new school with people I don’t know and a place I’ve not really gotten to see tomorrow.

19year old In need of help and guidancr,"Hi everyone, I'm a 19year old male just finished highschool. I will get straight to the point College is too expensive. parents can't afford it, even if they can I wouldn't want to burden them. I will want to pay for my own college. But the problem right now is that my parents are retired. I'm really worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I can't help them because my parents don't allow me to get a job because of the covid. I know I'm an adult but I don't have a driving license or a car yet. So instead I'm just learning to code day till night every single day. I need at least 6month to be job ready. I hope that I can get a front end job by then. I have many things to learn ( web design, color theory, SEO, coding etc). I have only just started learning to code 1month ago. I feel so stupid and idiotic for not starting it earlier. Negative thoughts have been haunting me recently, Is like I develop another personality. This personality only thinks of the bad thing for example like wanting to stab someone / myself, thinking of parents passing away etc. This kind of thoughts is appearing more often with each day passing. Also there is a side of me that feel like I'm missing out because all of my friends and classmate are all in college. This kind of negative thinking didn't appear at all when I was in school but because I heard from parents that they don't have enough money. Is been bothering me ever since I won't blame my parent and I know where I am now, I will work my way to get it but my headache and stress is getting worse every passing day, Im not taking any day off. Im very worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I'm worried that I won't have enough time to learn the things needed. I'm really scared that my parent 60+yo will passed away early. All of this is stressing me out really badly I want to help them but I don't know how I can help. I don't have allowance. Worse is that I don't have any skill or talent. I feel like I don't have enough time to learn the things I need to learn because there so many. Sometimes it doesn't even get absorbs by my head because I'm rushing it. Also recently I've been biting my nail and scratching my head till bleeding. I never had this habit before.","19year old In need of help and guidancr Hi everyone, I'm a 19year old male just finished highschool.

I feel like I’m screaming for help and no one is listening,"I’ve been trying to get better. Really trying. I’ve met with doctors to adjust my meds. I’ve missed 3 weeks of work getting all that shit sorted out, and trying to prioritize my mental health. Only to miss 3 weeks of pay and stress myself out more. As if 3 weeks could fix the 10 years of depression. I feel like everyone underplays how I’m feeling when I try to talk about it. I can’t decide if I want to just disappear, or end it. My family only cares about me getting back to work. It’s always been about just getting back to work. A job that I don’t even get a lunch break during, and no other breaks throughout the day. I’m a teacher. For 6th graders. Do I like my job? Yeah. Is it worth sacrificing even 10 minutes to get a deep breath and thought process in? Not so sure. Yet everyone this whole time has just asked “when do you go back to work?” Not how am I doing, how am I feeling, just when do I start making money again and being a productive member of society. Or “do it for the kids” and sometimes I just want to scream that maybe I need to make a decision FOR ME. I think the kids will be more traumatized if they learn their teacher off-ed herself because she realized it’s all fucking pointless. No one understands unless they’re going through it. Yet everyone wants to tell you what to do. They won’t say it but I know my parents and my boyfriend just think I’m weak and dramatic. My best friend at this point is my damn dog (who is the BEST boy and I really think the only reason I’ve held on this long). I’m at the point where I know I really want it all to end. But I wish a lightening bolt would just come down and do it for me so at least I won’t have died in a way that proves I am in fact just a weak loser. It sucks because I know I have passions and ambitions but they don’t align with the way everyone else wants me to live my life. And the cherry on top my fucking roommate is the most negative person I’ve ever met and leaves notes around the house about how much everything sucks! I’m negative too and agree everything sucks but goddammit I’m trying here and that’s not helpful. Even if it is sitting next to a fall scented candle. I can’t escape the depression and the negativity and I’m just so fucking exhausted!!!!!!!","I feel like I’m screaming for help and no one is listening I’ve been trying to get better. Really trying.

Can someone read this ? It’s my full story,"If I can have at least one person read this, it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life. I’m a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG’s than I did with my family. I’m not close with my family and I don’t ever will be because they are toxic af. I’ve been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can’t stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone’s feelings. School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don’t even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it’s not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then. Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don’t blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn’t much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn’t I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My “friend” saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade I’ve never been so lonely. 10th grade My existential crisis began. 11th grade suicide attempts. 12 burnout and more suicide attempts. I don’t want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can’t even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? Life is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I’ve overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don’t understand why people just won’t help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don’t to be homeless especially at this because it’s insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me. Even when I’m having my best day, I still always contemplate on suicide as if it’s the “answer” to my life. I low key wish someone would hug me — Thank you for reading. I’m grateful to whoever took the time out to read this. Sorry it was long. Edit- I really want to thank all of you for the kind words. Really I do. I wish I can meet all of you and you guys hugs because I was feeling lonely and felt the need to share I full story, but I didn’t expect this much feedback.

I’m really grateful for all for this community and all you who react out red_heart .",1,,can someone read this its my full story if i can have at least one person read this it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life im a black m in highschool who lives in the usa my interests fall in computer science math video games and animemanga when i was younger i loved video games so much and i still do to this day video games were the reason i was planning to work at a game development studio in the future i felt more understood by vgs than i did with my family im not close with my family and i dont ever will be because they are toxic af ive been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story they are the major cause for my depression and some for my suicidal tendencies as more time passed i would stay in my room as much as i can because i whenever i would step out my parents would drag with them to some store usually insult me or whine about how lazy i am my mom has been more abusive but at the same time she is an idiot who i was able fool on a few occasions my dad is annoying and racist for some ungodly reason he hates white people which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father my stepmom is stupid and racist so i cant stand her certainly least my sister is a literal bitch who has no regard for anyones feelings school is the worst thing to have ever happened to me i dont even know where to begin with school because i have had so much shitty stuff happen to me elementary school was ok i was easy target for harassment but its not as bad as it was in middle school when i was in elementary school i never saw the importance of school i barely did any work and never bothered to pay attention in class almost everyday in elementary school i just looked forward to going home and playing on my nintendo ds it was my major motivation back then then came middle school this is where so many problems came to rise words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was this is when school pressure really started hitting me and that i felt the need to work harder i had only like one friend in the beginning of grade and by then i began getting bullied by having that friend this friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student but i defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so i can keep being his friend one day at the end of the year my science teacher decided to expose me in front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work i dont blame her though lol next is th grade where there was no end to bullying throughout the school year i tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot i would do the most retarted shit just for attention because i felt so lonely worst idea ever now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me i asked i crush out and she rejected me wasnt much a big deal but i did feel pretty embarrassed after almost all my friends were fake and would easily turn their back on me whenever i was alone thoughts of self harm would become more frequent and whenever i wasnt i was being harassed by someone the last day of th grade is literally the worst day of my life completely lonely the first half then midday i accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete and it ruined the clothes i was wearing that day my friend saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can almost immediately when he found out he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb i looked with chalk on my clothes students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion i was so suicidal that day next is th grade not as terrible as th but still bad i was admitted into a th grade biology class because of my great grades in th grade environmental science but the biology class was horrible to be in the teacher was absolute shit and made it harder for us just for the sake of it when i came in that class on the first day i almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and i knew none of them some of the other students i sat with hated me because i got some of the concepts confusing insert some more embarrassing moments then you have th grade high school is better then middle school but i still hate school in general th grade ive never been so lonely th grade my existential crisis began th grade suicide attempts burnout and more suicide attempts i dont want to treat life as a separate entity but killed me this year i wish i can just take a mental break but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit if i cant even do it well in high school then how can i do it college life is so horrible i get abused for the most minor things and i dont know what to do anymore i have no idea what to do for the future because i ruined my grades and ive overthought what i want to be when i grow up i attempted suicide like over times this year but none of them work i dont understand why people just wont help me even when i reach out i wish my life just ended by whatever means i dont to be homeless especially at this because its insanely cold outside my point is everything is just not fucking fair i actively try do the most i can to rid depression and do my schoolwork but nobody will fucking cooperate with me even when im having my best day i still always contemplate on suicide as if its the answer to my life i low key wish someone would hug me thank you for reading im grateful to whoever took the time out to read this sorry it was long edit i really want to thank all of you for the kind words really i do i wish i can meet all of you and you guys hugs because i was feeling lonely and felt the need to share i full story but i didnt expect this much feedback im really grateful for all for this community and all you who react

How do I deal with school with depression?,"So I'm going into the 10th grade this year (which for some of you is year 11), but I'm very worried about how I'll be able to keep on top of school. Last school year I barely did anything at all -- I couldn't. The beginning of my academic downfall was when I was taken into a residential programme to deal with a series of mental problems. During and when I got out I felt too morbidly depressed to do pretty much anything, especially school work. I would never shower, never brush me teeth, never flush the toilet, never clean my bedroom, (you know the routine). My school is very demanding, but I was lucky that the faculty was aware that I wasn't able to be as ahead as my peers which helped because it felt as if everything was far too overwhelming to do and I physically could not without my head hurting or something of the sort. Now that summer is over and school is starting again, I have no idea how I'm going to manage keeping on top of my work. I do really want to try my best this year but I can barely complete or start my first few assignments without getting insanely overwhelmed. This year I won't get the same leniency as I did last year, and honestly I can't say I want it either because it too came with its downsides. Other kids would get angry at me because I was exempt from doing some assignments, and also it made me feel as if I'd failed at being a human along with everything else. I could barely keep on top of my hygiene, I wouldn't eat, I could barely get out of bed or look the slightest bit decent when leaving the house. It was as if I was a baby that had to be carried around due to it's helplessness, I hated it. albeit It was far better than drowning in my own academic failure and being personally held accountable for my lack of effort towards my education. In conclusion, I'm wondering how I can keep on top of school work without getting very overwhelmed due to my depression?","How do I deal with school with depression?

43 and completely lost,"I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct. I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression. I'm so disappointed in the person I've become. No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges. I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations. I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking. I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave. I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years. My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder. I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy. Nothing seems to help. I'm unbelievably critical of myself. Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit. I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written. I'm even more amazed by the responses. How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice? I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained. I can't imagine giving advice to someone. There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress. I'm a mess right now. I have lost hope of getting better. I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day. I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents. Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me. The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since. I have some solid friends that I've known since high school. They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. I can't seem to learn anything these days. I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things. I can't imagine surviving another 40 years. I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer. I've no real skills to rely on. I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day. I no longer think I'm capable of having a family. Too overwhelming. I would be an awful spouse and father. I don't plan to go back to work. I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life. By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them. My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run. I've read so much on coping with this disease. But so little spurs me to action. Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions. The weed stopped working for me though. Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse. Thanks for reading all this. I love you.","43 and completely lost I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct. I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.

"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length","Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff. My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way. As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly. My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive","Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone.

With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive",1,,bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide posting some ramblings here because i feel alone its long and i apologise for the length dont know where to start but currently im in airbnbs using what little savings i have trying not to think about commiting suicide i used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing i could do it whenever i was ready and when i realized how calm that made me i decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice i live in the desert in arizona but i grew up in california ive always felt alone and suicidal since a child i was raised by my grandparents as far back as i can remember after my mother left to az after my half brother was born years later my half sister was born there after my grandparents passed when i was i had to move to az ive learned growing up i was around dangerous settings and car accidents in infancy and im worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way on top of the regular stuff my grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment i never told them these feelings because i wanted to be a perfect son for them in exchange for what they did for me my grandpa was an old school cowboy type traditional conservativebut never once told me i had to be any certain way as you can probably tell polar opposite here in azi have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like yes no photos anyways i was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in ca but hes been out for a few years already somehow and my mother and step father are convinced im a murderous sociopath thats going to kill them all one day randomly my step father choked me and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because i make them feel uneasy stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me leading to my airbnb situation most days at home i kept to myself in my room but in october i went back to california for weeks when my depression was hitting its peak to see if i had hope or needed closure or something i went back to my hometown and didnt feel any pain i was happy for once i was with my girlfriend who i wanted to take to prom back in ca before i had to move and it feels like ever since i left my life was in limbo i want to go back to live with her but i need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment and its extremely difficult however she told me shes been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well its honestly the only reason i havent done it yet but deep down i feel like this wont work out i have this sense of abandonment so i default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood ive told myself over and over no one really cares about you and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships but whats really making me finally want to go through with it is that i did gig work so ive been getting stimulus and the pua so basically money to just sit around doing nothing i was living at home with my mother so i saved all the money i have the title to my car nothing crazy no debt no student loans and a credit score i was always the chubby kid but since covid ive lost weight like pounds smoking weed and drinking water i can get girls i lost my virginity and im still absolutely depressed and suicidal i even put off losing weight for so long because i was so scared if i got in shape and hooked up with women wasnt immediately happy no im actually feeling worse because now what i know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression but i lost that weight paid off my car reduced my debts etc the next goal would be to have my own home but thats just adding time to the clock like i did with my weight problem all of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and i should just isolate myself or die i have no family when i was living with my grandparents until no one ever came to visit or help and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood i dont know aunties cousins uncles or any of that that abandonment feeling was heightened because of this because my grandparents to me my real parents were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying it reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationshipfriendship i have no one really cares i feel like no matter what life will not get better and i wont be happy just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy i dont want to live for decades this way and id much rather die at peace not to mention how in my lifetime id be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isnt even appreciative of being alive one other thing is holding me back is that im perfectly healthy and wish i could give all my organs away i know they have to be on ice but i was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature but my kidneys could help save a childs life so it feels like a waste and insult im also very scared of dying and there

and want to die to i feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if i was never born i dont keep ammo with me because now i feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping

I’m so tired.,"I thought when school reopened and normal learning would commence, I’d be ok. That I’d be away from my family, and I wouldn’t feel so horrible all the time. That was a fucking lie, because apparently school is overwhelming as fuck too. I can’t hold a conversation without overthinking, I embarrass myself and act weird, and this sounds stupid as fuck but I’m terrified of the boys in my class. They’re not dangerous or any of that, they’re just so loud I wonder how they can retain so much life inside of them. I can’t do it. The cycle, the heaviness, both physical and mental, my demanding studies. I guess my next plan is to get into a good university, and keep up my academics so I can get a job and move out. There’s this kind of prize ceremony at my school where you can win scholarships, but I don’t know if I should try because I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I failed to secure a good future for myself. I mean, I’m still freshman so I shouldn’t put to much emphasis into my future as of yet. I still have time. But I feel like I’ve been thrown in for a loop because I don’t even think I’ll make it past graduation age alive. I have to get up. My bag is so heavy with the textbooks. My body hurts from all the cuts, and bandages are such a nuisance. My parents are so overwhelming and scary. Im not even that smart of a person. I made the choice of joining this UN council type thing as an after school program. I thought it’d look good on college applications, but I’m a very shy and withdrawn person and I’ve realized I’m probably going to get my ass kicked in any debate. The other students in the council are so much more clear with their words, more accomplished and brilliant than I am. I don’t stand next to them at all. I thought this last year sucked ass. I don’t know what I’m going to do about this one. Thanks for listening to my rant, if you’ve read this far. I bid you a good day","I’m so tired.

Whining about my past and current state,"I really don't know what to write, but I somehow have to get this off my chest. Might be a bit of rambling, but I've got nobody to actually talk to (also sorry for some mistakes, german fellow here) Okay, so a little background story. Basically since I'm 12/13 (I'm 22 now) I'm suffering from mental problems, mostly depression. At a time it was also severe social anxiety. I've been in a hospital for it for around 2 months. I got into it because I admitted to contemplating suicide. But basically after getting out it didn't really get better. Why all of that? Well... My parents divorced at a young age. My back then stepdad was an asshole. Nothing was more important to him than his house, car and work. He's my little brothers dad and I guess I don't need to tell you that my big brother and I weren't of big interest for him. We had this big ass house, but nothing was getting done. He was never home, me and my brother went to school, my little brother was a baby, my mom was also working and I had to see her burning out more and more. Then she divorced him after getting back the strength and I got sucked into a lawsuit. He took my little brother and didn't bring him back. So... court appointments, youth welfare office, appraisers... All being at home, wanting to speak to me as well (my back then stepdad said that my mother was not able to keep kids)... If this wasn't enough. My big brother and I also never really had the best relationship since his dad never cared about him and he saw how my dad cared about me. But my dad also is someone who's suffering from some kind of anxiety and maybe I learned from it upside-down_face However... School was never better. I was basically always bullied. Can't remember a time in school this wasn't the case until the last year. And that's it. I got to know a beautiful girl. Apparently I caught her eye and she reached out to me... Three years of a almost perfect relationship. Before that I only had a guy who sexually took advantage of me... It really was a long time I haven't been that happy. She was beautiful, she was smart, funny and so on... But in the end she left me for another dude. This was two years ago and I'm still suffering from it. Not that I want back. I just... Can't start anything new. So let's add ""trust issues"" to the list. But that's not just because of this. After it I tried dating other people. But in the end it was them fucking others while being with me, trying to get their ex bfs jealous or other stuff like that. I kinda got into that spiral of just having meaningless sex with dudes or girls I found on Grindr or Tinder (also I never got to out me and I really regret that). But that was a big problem, because I realized how superficial a lot of people are. I wouldn't say I'm ugly... I'm really not. Actually from most people I get compliments. ""You are so beautiful"". Or the best friend of my ex said ""everytime you see Toni he's getting hotter"". I started working out, lost some weight and it was good until covid happened and I had to stop. It got me into a spiral again I can't get out. I hate my body again, I gained weight, I hate looking in the mirror in general. I just don't like what I see. Now I wanted to start training again, but of course I fell while biking and now my hand hurts... It's like whenever something seems to get better some higher entity is like ""you thought haha"". What about friends you ask? Never really had them. I met some really cool people when I was with my girlfriend. I thought. When she broke up they all told me ""Toni we want this friendships to last, don't worry"", just to abandon me and never hearing of them again after a few months. Even after I reached out multiple times. And now? Well I wanted to start over again. Moved from my hometown to a new City, got into university. ""New City, New opportunities, New friends"". Well. Covid was like ""nope"" (everything was online), it seems like I'm too dumb for what I'm doing, I'm still only sitting at home, wasted another summer and... I just wonder... Will it ever stop? Will it ever get better? Slowly I'm thinking it will never get better. That every high will just be followed by another down that will tear down everything I've built up so far. ""You got money? Well here's you're washing machine broken! Finally got a person you like? Well they fuck someone else! Finally took the step to a better life? Well I'll do everything that it will be the same in the end! Finally happy with your body and took the step to go to the gym? Well gyms are closed now! Lost 10kg of weight? Well you'll hate yourself either way, don't you? Gyms are open again? Well, fucking fall while biking, hurt your hand and and damage your bike so you can't even bike anymore, because you've got no money to repair it! And let's face it... You need money for a new PC first, because yours is broken and you need one for university, you need new clothes, at least a jacket for when it gets colder!"". I really can't do this anymore. Maybe I'm just whiny... I don't know. But in the end that's just a small insight into my life. I'm 22 now and I'm at that point again I wonder if it even makes sense anymore. Especially when the current state of the world is not getting better either. And the worst thing is... Compared to others, looking at what I've reached yet (at least looking at my apartment). I feel horrible, because I should probably feel good about myself, because I've got it better. I've invested a lot of money into it and I'm really happy with how it turned out. Others would dream of that at that age... Maybe I just can't get enough? I really don't know... Thanks for reading tho. Don't know if anyone got some advice or ideas what I can do.

I didn't know I was depressed,"I have been on lexapro for a week. I know that I'm not seeing the full effects of the drug yet, but I already notice less anxiety and the ability to perform basic tasks without a mental battle. I didn't know I could feel this way. My entire teen and adult life, I have just thought it was normal to struggle to go get the laundry done, to clean the dishes, to take care of myself, to do my job. I didn't understand why other people made it seem so easy, I thought they all had just figured it out or they had been raised with a better work ethic & that I was lazy. I'm not, I suffer from depression and anxiety. I waited until I was 32 to find this out. I waited until I had a major life change, a devastating breakup episode to seek real help other than just counseling. Holy shit what I could have done if I had known sooner.","I didn't know I was depressed I have been on lexapro for a week.

Stressed about MCAT any advice is appreciated,"Hey so I have always wanted to go into med school and have just recently graduated from my university with a bachelors degree. I am set for med school (hopefully) , but I have to score decent on this MCAT first. I just feel super overwhelmed on where to start and what to focus on. I signed up for Blueprint and they made my free study plan, but I do not want to spend 1,500 just to prepare for this exam. I tried using it in conjunction with Khan Academy, but something about Khan Academy is not helpful, their questions are but not their videos. I was wondering if anyone has some advice for help they could give so I could do well for my MCAT. I plan to take it in January","Stressed about MCAT any advice is appreciated Hey so I have always wanted to go into med school and have just recently graduated from my university with a bachelors degree.

If my depression spiked during the corona virus is it really depression or is it regular?,"Before the corona virus came I was suffering from being emotional numb this was because of things outside the virus but would take to long for me to explain however once the corona virus hit my mental health and self care dropped to the floor. For me I was in the 7th grade the first time the corona virus was brought up and we went on lockdown. During does first 6 months as I had my summer break to I played video games constantly with my friends from the uk as that was where I use to live and I was feeling great at the time because any kid at that age would love to not go to school for 6 months, but whilst does months were going by I started realizing how unproductive my daily routine was and how bad my social skills were getting. By this time I was in the 8th grade and now we actually had to do online school. The only thing is me being in my room 24-7 for 6 months straight not doing anything but playing games and eating made my numbness way worse. At this point I started not caring about life anymore and instead of living it would just feel like I’m existing in a dead corpse. It got so bad that I cheated on every online work I got and I did not feel bad at all and I still don’t. Even when I had to go in person to do my final exams I knew i was gonna fail them but still didn’t care. Now I’m a freshman in highschool and I honestly can’t see myself doing anything but working at a fast food restaurant once I finish school. Bring abled to make friends has gotten so as to the point where I find it hard to speak to new people online. To be honest highschool isn’t the worst I’m glad I get to go in person because it’s forcing me to speak to people however I’ve spoke to people about this depression and a lot of people say it is because of COVID however I haven’t seen much people talk about it here. In all honesty I’m hoping that does people are right because I’ve had this numbness for 2 years now and I don’t want it to be something I have to live with forever.","If my depression spiked during the corona virus is it really depression or is it regular?

How to Be Happy (Instead of Miserable) When You Become 60+,"Millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal. But few define what happiness means, often leading us to chase what our parents, friends, and role models defined as happiness. So when we are back to wearing diapers, we realize we ignored everything we genuinely esteemed. In my experience studying dozens of happiness frameworks and science-backed studies about happiness, I've found the best chance at being happy at any time comes from defining what happiness isn't. It's like an inverse happiness checklist. In it, you write what doesn't bring you joy and then ensure your current pursuit of happiness, whether it is to travel the world or become wealthy, doesn't include any of the items from the checklist.  The inverse checklist serves two purposes it helps define happiness and tells you which activities to remove from your life. So, for example, if you conclude money doesn't bring joy. But you work from 9-9 because ""hustle is life,"" then reduce the number of, say, side projects you have. Otherwise, you'll be frustrated after reaching financial ""freedom"" and likely feel physically and mentally exhausted. Each person's definition of happiness varies. However, most people can include specific items into their inverse checklist to define happiness. Your definition of happiness cannot reject distress We can't control the decisions and behaviors of humans, animals, or nature. Otherwise, hurricanes and phone thieves wouldn't exist. So no matter the statistical formula you use to predict events or the number of possible scenarios you draw on your whiteboard, potential sources of unhappiness are always around the corner.  To avoid the discomfort from harmful events, some people write a list of sources of distress and eliminate them from their life. For example, they quit their job to run from their nerve-racking boss. Or switch majors. The issue with this list is its potential size—it's infinite because any event in our lives can distress us. A more efficient solution is to invite distress into your life. And realizing happiness can coexist with events that don't match our definition of a perfect activity, day, or life. For example, a harmless event like Microsoft Word crashing before letting you save an article could either ruin your day. Or it could become a fun challenge to overcome. When you welcome distress, you experience two benefits. First, you become used to different causes of discomfort, reducing their chances of affecting you. Second, you realize distress can (and must) coexist with happiness.    Your definition of happiness cannot come from others Most of us chase a definition of happiness that other people set for us, leading to repentance during our deathbed. For example, some people accumulate academic titles to impress their parents, while others seek minimalism according to a monk's advice.  In college, psychologists, doctors, and nurses taught me around 80% of older people under palliative care regretted their lives' choices. But you don't need wrinkles or to be in a hospital to regret your life. So instead, change it today.  First, write down a list of scenarios that would bring happiness to your life. You can then describe the benefits of each scenario and the barriers between you and them. Second, answer the most crucial question ""who's someone in my life who believes this scenario would bring happiness?""  Ask yourself one last question ""Is this goal worth pursuing even though X person shares it?""  Contrast your answer with other items from your checklist. So if you think happiness is living amongst your friends in the countryside (goal), your friends feel the same (influence), but your inverse checklist says you *don't* like being away from the city, then stop pursuing that goal. Avoid being miserable on your deathbed. While your DNA differs from the millions of people who have regretted their life's choices on their deathbeds, you may be following another person's definition of happiness—just like they did. Unfortunately, the old and sick don't have the strength to change their lives drastically. But you do.  So start developing today a definition of happiness your elderly self will accept, one *you* truly believe.  **Share one item you would add to your inverse happiness checklist below.** If you are not comfortable doing it publicly, please DM me on Twitter at @ MrNicolasForero — I'm curious to discover what you would add.","How to Be Happy (Instead of Miserable) When You Become 60+ Millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal.

I’m worried I’m losing touch with reality,"Hi, I’m under a lot of family and social stress, and I’m freaking out because I think I’m starting to lose it. I keep hearing things that I’m not sure are really there, like incoherent whispering, humming, creaking or breathing. I have really vivid, disturbing hallucinations while I’m on the verge of sleep that make me afraid to go to bed at night, the slightest sound panicking me. I’m an excessive daydreamer (not something I want to get rid of) which means I’m constantly in my own head, but it’s becoming harder and harder to control my thoughts. Sometimes I’ll become so entrenched in a mental argument I’ll be motionless for up to half an hour at a time, sometimes to the point of tears. I’ve tried all that ‘mindfulness’ stuff and it doesn’t help me whatsoever, if anything it only stresses me out more. I’m scared to seek help because I don’t want to be seen as “just another attention seeking teenager,” and have already been dismissed by my mother when I shared my concerns. My dad has depression himself and I don’t want to stress him out any more. There’s nobody else I’m particularly close to. At this exact moment I’m the only one still awake at my house and every little sound around me is freaking me out. I’ve had a strange feeling building up for weeks, I can only compare it to the feeling you have when you’re dreaming and only a part of you knows it. Of course I know this is reality, but that feeling won’t go away.","I’m worried I’m losing touch with reality Hi, I’m under a lot of family and social stress, and I’m freaking out because I think I’m starting to lose it.

Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding... He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die"" I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back. He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone. I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life. Edit Thank you everyone for the words and suggestions. I have read over each one multiple times. It helps. Sometimes the words from strangers and people traversing through similar waters helps. I will continue to read these.

Freshman in uni for 2 weeks but I´m already stressed and exhausted,"I´ve been studying for just 2 weeks in university, but it´s already too much for me. Everytime a lesson starts, we get an assigment. I already have to make 5 assigments and 7 presentations. I have to finish two presentations until Thursday, I have to finish my assigment before Tuesday, and I also have a presentation on Wednesday (my ADHD isn´t really helping me either). And I have to find a free day to go to the doctor´s, because I might have celiac disease. It´s been just two weeks, and it´s already too much. I´m already feeling anxious all the time about the quality of the assigments. I don´t have time to chill out. I constantly feel exhausted, my back hurts, and I´m irritated and agressive all the time. I´ve already gave up on all of my hobbies. I barely talk to anyone. I sleep for 4 or 5 hours, because I have so much homework to do. My mom keeps threatening me with kicking me out if I don´t meet her expectations. She keeps demanding more and more from me, but I just can´t keep up with her requirements. She also keeps making threats to throw out my headphones whenever I wear them outside. And she keeps trying to read all my messages and she wants to know about everything I do. When I asked her why, she just said that it´s for my own sake. She is so controlling that everytime she hears me type on a keyboard, she comes to my room to check if I´m writing an assigment. And if I´m not, she hits me, screams at me and tells me to get to it, and that she wants me to have more pages written than what professors required. She keeps telling me to find a job, which I want to do, only if I had more time. And now, on top of my father´s alimonies, she now requires monthly payments of half of what he sends in monthly, and she is expecting me to pay for internet and TV. My girlfriend thinks that it´s funny and cute when I´m angry or frustrated, so she keeps trying to make me even angrier by any means. When I asked her if she even cares about how I feel, she just laughed and said that ""Yeah, I care about you, but it´s funny to watch you get angry."". We are in a long distance relationship, and when I try to call her in the evenings to talk about stuff, she just says that she is out with friends or that she is too tired to talk to me, even when she promises me to talk to me the day before. I straight up told her ""We should break up if all I´m good for is the amusement you get out of my struggles."", and she just said ""Nah, I like watching you get mad for no reason."". She´s really pushing our relationship to the edge of breakup, but I don´t want to stay alone, because frankly, I have no friends left, and she is my last person left that I can even remotely consider a friend. I nearly busted into tears in front of a crowd of people today. I can barely hold it all back. Even my new classmates keep wondering about why am I so down all the time, because for them, it´s a walk in the park. Yeah, for me it´s a walk in a park as well, but the park is on fucking fire, because it´s a park near Satan´s flaming balls. Everybody wants too much from me, and I can´t carry that burden. I want to find a way out, but I don´t know what to do.","Freshman in uni for 2 weeks but I´m already stressed and exhausted I´ve been studying for just 2 weeks in university, but it´s already too much for me.

I've tried but I don't know what else to do,"Sorry for the new throwaway account but I don't want any of my family or friends to know this is me Background info I'm a 16 year old female, school for me starts in about 2 weeks (a little less) TW for mentions of suicide - Okay so... I've tried. I've really tried. For years,actually, for most of my life, I've been suicidal. I've always found something to blame my emotions on but at this point I think I'm just depressed. For the majority of the time I've kept it to myself. Only ever told a couple very close friends, but never my family directly. But recently I decided to tell them... most things. Not everything, but a lot. Because ""I can go to them with anything"" right? Well I told them I was stressed out about school and that I don't think stressing out over tests is worth it right now. I said that school should come second, mental health first. They freaked out about this. Basically told me I'm lazy and need to focus on school cause ""that's my job."" They made me feel like it was ""wrong"" to ever say or think such a thing. I told them that I was stressed out about my future and feel like I need to do more towards my career. They basically said that's not important right now, worry about it later or ""on the side."" I even said that I'm suicidal. And when I said that I thought they might calm down and realize I actually have a problem, I'm not okay. But my Dad just yelled at me and my Mom didn't say a thing. I felt no concern or anything. Just anger. I don't feel like ever opening up to them again. I don't understand how they don't see this is a cry for help. Even other things, like how I've been sleeping more lately. My grades dropped near the end of last year. I've lost interest in hobbies. Seems like a ton of signs but they just get mad and act like I basically need to figure it out and stop being ""lazy.""

Not Sure What To Do,"So a little background. First, this isn't my main Reddit account and the name is coincidental... but accurate. Second, I've suffered from pretty extreme anxiety for pretty much my whole life, but it's only really been the last 2-3 years I've suffered from the kind of symptoms you would generally associate with bad depression. And the last week has sent me over the edge in both regards. I'm falling behind in college even though it's a subject I should, and do, love. I feel my a few of my teachers are complete assholes, and events in my life during the last week have really put me down. Between all that, I'm honestly having a panic attack right now about class this morning. To be honest, the events of the last week turned my depression into the realm of suicide ideation. I hate to say that, but I have thought about it. I had to take my father to the hospital, and I didn't know if he was going to come back. And then my mother found stuff which didn't paint him in a great light. I've felt like complete crap ever since. I'm calling a doctor today after class today, and I'm going to get help. I don't want to live like this, and I can't. I can't keep feeling the way I do, because I know it is a path to self-destruction, and I don't know if it's me specifically or the rest of the world or a combination. All I know is I need help, I can't do it myself. I hate asking for help but I need it. I dunno. I'm not sure what to do. I don't have anyone to turn to or talk to.

Nobody has ever shown romantic interest in me,"Context I am a 20 year old college student with severe clinical depression and anxiety. I have a decent amount of friends and we pretty regularly hang out and go out together. My friends say I’m not an unlikable person, I have some hobbies including reading and writing, I’m told I’m pretty funny and as far as I know my friends and family like having me around, however I tend to be more on the introverted side and don't always take to people right away. I also don’t think I’m necessarily ugly, just not attractive. I have a skinny build, I'm 5'10"", etc. etc. I've gone through two whole decades of my life and not a single person has ever shown a romantic interest in me. I have had and currently have plenty of friends who are girls and have never had an issue talking with them, so it's not like I am someone who never puts themselves out there. During quarantine, a bunch of friends and I downloaded Tinder as a way to talk to people around campus while we stayed shut in our apartments/homes. Nothing really came of it, but I quickly realized that I wasn't having the same experience as all my other friends. They were getting tons of matches and likes, and I was only getting a few likes/matches. All the conversations I had with matches never seemed to go anywhere, despite trying different approaches and even having my friends give me advice. When I brought up my lack of likes/matches to my friends, they tried ""overhauling"" my profile to be more like theirs, but there was no change. Tonight a couple friends and I were hanging out and they were all swiping through Tinder (and getting matches) while discussing their plans with some of these girls to hookup/hangout. Obviously I had nothing to contribute to the conversation and just sat there, scrolling through Tinder while watching my friend next to me get 3 matches in a row. I felt awful. I'm just so tired of it all. I wasn't worried in high school about girls/relationships as I figured I'd have plenty of chances in college to pursue those things, but I'm coming to realize that people are just not interested in me. I feel like I've tried everything, and seeing my friends put no effort into any of it and still have so many girls coming to them makes me feel like just giving up. I'm scared because I feel that after I graduate, it's only going to be that much harder to meet people. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone is/has been in the same boat and if anyone has any advice.","Nobody has ever shown romantic interest in me Context I am a 20 year old college student with severe clinical depression and anxiety.

Asian parents is guilt tripping me on paying their rent. 18yo in need of guidance,"Hi I live in Malaysia, I'm 18yo going to be 19yo this coming November. I have two sister, one is 20yo another is 22yo. I have just graduated from high school and my mother is asking me to help pay for rent, I don't have any skill I have only just started learning to code whereas both my sister had a few year break and is playing games 24/7 even right now they are playing. Although one is studying biomedical whenever she have free time is just games. My parents doesn't have much money left and we r just barely getting by but my parents continue to buy useless/ unnecessary snack, coffee etc. Also my mother likes to waste water by cleaning the floor multiple times with just only water (OCD) not soap even when I have already clean it. I have also already told them many many times (throughout 11 - 18yo) to not buy any more snack, and have told my mother that washing with water does not really clean the area and also told my sister to help out with the chores at least. But my effort is all for nothing, I have only added extra stress in my life. Is it wrong to think that this is unfair or am I being in the wrong here? Because when I'm telling my sister to learn some skill instead of playing games they get defensive and started to argue with me. I didn't force them to learn I'm just telling them that they should learn something instead of playing games whole day My parents father 60+yo, mother 50+yo both have not work for a really long time. I won't and can't tell them to work because they r my parents, and I'm still living under their roof I have already gave up telling them what to do, because of this I have learned that you can't actually tell people what to do if they not willing to listen, and change. I'm In constant stress, my parents doesn't allow me to work because of Covid. So instead while I still have roof under my head I'm doing everything I can to learn the necessary coding skill / graphic design so I can start working. When I was younger I told my mother I will help with the rent but that was a year ago I didn't really think that through, my mistake on my part. Now my mother is guilt tripping me to pay for the rent. I'm using my allowance and am also out of cash ( shouldn't even be called allowance since I'm technically returning the money ) Because of this stress, I'm also constantly thinking why do so many people have a child when they are not financially stable or mentally prepared to be a parent. What do people expect when they have a child? Isn't it just a cycle, baby, adolescent, teenager > go college, young adult > start working, old adult > retired and have a child. Then cycle repeats again and again. In my case my parent want me to continue the family name. What would your advice be? Am I being a spoiled child? Note My parents is loving but to me they r not ready to be a parent. ( They always argue, talk about money in front of me and my sister, not telling my sister to do any chore. Etc ). I don't have any driving license and my parents are also quite strict I quite embarrassed to say this but I cant ride on a public bus without their permission first. I had my Covid shot but parent still won't let me work outside.My sister is not helping to pay rent, I can't tell them what to do because they will go defensive and we will be in an argument again Don't have to sugar coat your answer, I'm also writing here so that I can improve on myself.

Tomorrow my depression will be one year old. I don't know if I need to celebrate or to complain my self.,"I am 18 years old, I am from Mexico and until a few months ago I realized that I could have something upset. At the beginning of August 2019 my life took a pretty good turn, everything was going to improve and it did. my school demanded so much time that I didn't have time for anything I was extremely happy. everything was going well, grades, friends, I was even going to start a relationship with a very special girl, my family had finally found a balance. When the pandemic arrived, I was not so affected, but it all started when my cousin decided to commit suicide on August 31, 2020, without any sign or warning, it was all very sudden. They asked me to give a few words at his funeral but I couldn't, and all those things that I still had to say I kept to myself. All this year I had good times and bad, but little by little everything rotted, my family separated completely, my school closed and that dream of having graduated from that school disappeared. After all, I filled many of my afternoons smoking marijuana and tried to fill in those little holes that I was living. In March it was the last time I saw my mother because of a stupid thing I did and that every day makes me feel guilty. I filled my days with depressing philosophy, I walked away from all my friends, my life really stopped. Sometimes I start to think and I imagine myself with a psychologist talking about my problems, and only realizing that my life is wrong, but what could it be wrong? I do not have any disability or something, some disease that prevents me from being happy. But problems overwhelm me and take my breath away, I am speechless in these situations.

"Help coping with extreme, long term stress? I'm going crazy","Hi, I'm 18, and I've been non stop stressed since mid-March. It started during spring break, when all of my roommates went home except for me. I'm really bad at being alone. It made me so anxious and stressed that I got the flu and a severe UTI, as well as abdominal pain. Later, because I was stressed about the UTI, I got really bad chest pain. Then, I started my first major curriculum class, which stressed me out because the teacher was tough and I was the only freshman. Then we had to choose housing and there wasn't enough housing for every student (good job, school), so that had me freaking out pretty horribly. Then, it was time to move out of the freshman dorms, which was a bit overwhelming. In May, my dad told me that he was selling his house, and he wasn't very nice about it. I'm really emotionally attached to that house, so that's stressing me out a lot too. The thought of leaving it makes me want to just lay down on the floor and cry (in fact, I have done so), and he's not being sympathetic at all (as in, when I get sad about it he tells me to grow the hell up). So that's a *constant* stresser. THEN, my dad and my aunt got in a massive fight, and my dad pulled out of helping me buy my plane ticket to visit her in LA. My friends had already gotten their tickets, and I had to find a way to get mine on my own (my place of work closed in January, and I need so much time off this summer that nobody in their right mind would hire me). All the while, I was caught right in the middle of their insane argument. I got really close to cancelling the trip. That was the catalyst for my current predicament, I think. I am currently sick, and I have been for two weeks. I feel horrible all of the time, and get nauseous and dizzy after eating. My heartbeat skyrockets, and I get really shaky too. I saw my GP, and after a physical examination, she chalked it up to all of the stress coming down pretty hard on me. I can't keep letting this stress rule over me like this. It's literally making me sick. What are some ways that I can go about coping with it and keeping it from kicking me to the ground like this? I've gotta do something. I am on medication, but since it's a new prescription, it's going to be a month or so before I see any real improvement.","Help coping with extreme, long term stress?

Could my husband be depressed? How could I help?,"Long story short. We have been together for 15+ years. His family is pure academics. Both parents and siblings are phds and postdocs from prestigious schools. I later learned that his mom had been suffering from depression very early on and had been taking medication for a long time. His sister is also depressed to a point that she could not go to class and do home work. His mom had to fly to her school to watch her. She is still taking medication. My husband on the other hand is also a little “crazy”. He always have very unrealistic ideas. And it was ALL TALKS! No action of any sorts. I am really tired of just being the listener and know it’s pure talk. I am a little angry right now because we just had an argument. I am pregnant in my third trimester and he was keep saying the house we live in is shit the weather is too hot. The whole place is shit. He had no friends and no jobs. The world is collapsing and he wanted to abandon me to live in a mountain by the lake in Chattanooga. He just stopped taking coffee and it could be just his withdrawal symptoms. That is another thing. His mom, his sister and himself were all extremely addicted to alcohol and caffeine. They all tried other drugs in schools but I don’t think they are taking them anymore. We always have arguments whenever he is drinking too much or having withdrawals. I wish I could just deal with it once and not all the time. This emotion ups and downs. I wish he could go to a therapist and get tested but he is too proud to do it. He says I am the one that has mental problems. (I do not drink alcohol or caffeine or smoke or have done any drugs in my life. And I do not have any family history mental illness)","Could my husband be depressed? How could I help?

Stress is starting to overcome my life. Help?,"I have always been stressed. When I was in my teenage years, I had migraines everyday. Medically unexplained. For years. Turns out it was just my body's way of coping with stress. I have been better at handling said stress with the years. I am now doing pretty good at handling myself with a normal level of stress. However, I am still handling stress badly when it is a new amount of stress (for example here, new job, bought an apartment w/ my boyfriend but things are not so good between us, having to move to a new place, a friend living on my couch for some time...) It is tiring for me to be under stress like that. It makes me cry randomly, have bad headaches and lash out a lot. I don't want to, but it seems like my stress needs to escape my body in any possible way. I am comfortable around my boyfriend, so it happens a lot that I am losing it around him because it feels like a safe environment. It is however making my relationship more difficult than it should be, to the point where he says he is really considering ending it.

I have a lot of things going on at the same time and it’s making me stressed to the point I feel sick.,"I’m hoping that somehow me typing all this out will help me overcome everything and make me feel better. I started a new job in the beginning of November. Everything was going good until Thanksgiving. My fiancée and I made the decision we would visit family that day. In hindsight, that was stupid. The day after, my sister started feeling sick and tested positive for COVID, and then her family was getting sick and the ones that got tested were positive. My work told me I had to quarantine, but since I was new, they wouldn’t give me paid leave. That left we with 2 weeks of not getting any money. Thankfully, I had some savings to help scrape by on bills, but I had to go through all of that. Since then, I’ve been struggling and the end of the month bill marathon has been cutting it too close. Had a lot of unexpected expenses. We’ve been living in a 1 bedroom apartment and we are wanting to move into a house because we have no room for anything. Had to store a lot of belongings in our cars. We are also planning a wedding for the end of October. I’m trying to go back to school so I don’t have to work a 3rd shift factory job for the rest of my life. She’s been dealing with PTSD for a few years and has had an uptick in panic attacks the past few weeks. It’s become too much for me to handle. Been dealing with suicidal thoughts.

wondering what the hell is wrong with me At first I thought my depression started when the first girl I liked made fun of me and humiliated me but then I realized I had the depression since I was young maybe because I was alone and had no friends maybe because Everytime I force myself to socializing things turn awkward or take a left turn During the pandemic I loved the idea of wearing face masks hiding my face and my emotions was something that made me feel comfortable and confident also wearing a hoodie I was like a ghost walking around not worried about what people think of me I have suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday couple months ago a neighbor's daughter was my age (20yrs old) committed suicide threw herself from a 12th floor hitting her head in the middle of the street at

I think my life is destined to end in suicide,"My depression never goes away even though I've cycled through different therapists and medication for 7+ years now. Everything is much worse than before. The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone. This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed. Edit Honestly wow. I wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out. I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore. I especially didn't know that so many could relate to these kinds of thoughts. This is the dark side of depression that people don't want to talk about. All I can say is that I'm still here for now fighting on another day.","I think my life is destined to end in suicide My depression never goes away even though I've cycled through different therapists and medication for 7+ years now.

“It’s okay not to be okay”,"Please shut the fuck up. No, it isn’t. No one really believes that. What you really mean is it’s okay to not be okay as long as it doesn’t affect your life in any way. As long it’s something quirky or fucking cute like anxiety or mild depression (not the crazy bipolar type, though!). As long as you can still be productive and fucking perfect. Schizophrenic? Psychopathic? Paranoid? Terminally angry? You’re a sick freak who needs to be locked up. It’s even worse when it’s schools spouting this hippie, pop-psychology bullshit. You know you’re only trying to cover your bases for when some kid slashes their wrists. I promised I wouldn’t kill myself because I owe it to my parents to outlive them. Fuck that. I won’t even make it to university. This is the third time I’m pulling an all-nighter this week to finish work and I haven’t even been fucking working for the last 6 hours. I don’t feel sad and I don’t even feel tired or numb. I know exactly what I feel. My will to die may finally have overpowered my crippling apathy. I’m not cut out for this world and I’d rather make my parents feel horrible guilt than face their disappointment when I become a useless, alcoholic basket case. Yes, I’m a fucking coward.

How I overcame my pornography addiction & why I started to change my life for the better.,"This is tough for me to talk about but I thought this story will help inspire men. Growing up as a teenager I had a really bad pornography addiction. I used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence. It made my dating life and sex life horrible. I knew I was better than that, I could not believe this was taking over my life and how could I let it get this far. So one day I was like fuck this I need to get my life together. I started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies. I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it. I started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer. I EVEN started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography. It was a very tough process but I was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 1/2 months. So the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you. What controls your mind controls your life! Mental toughness! ","How I overcame my pornography addiction & why I started to change my life for the better.

Help] Stress/Anxiety is making me sick,"Hey r/Stress, I am not too sure if this is the correct place to post this, but give me a read and if its not I will find the correct place to go. A little background before I explain, I am a senior Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering student in the US getting ready to finish up the semester and get married, all within the next month. Here is the problem I am failing a class right now that would seriously hinder my future success if I do not pass \(my perspective, anyway\) and it is seriously hurting my productivity. I am sick to my stomach \~70% of the time , cannot sleep on a beneficial schedule, and am finding myself with no discipline/motivation for anything. The main source of this stress is a scholarship I am on that requires payback if you lose it, meaning I would be in the whole about $20,000 if I fail and get kicked out. The contract states you can either be kicked out or placed on probation, but I cannot find any precedent on what direction they lean. Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health. I am reaching here, I really need some help. My fiance, bless her heart, is not much help because of planning the wedding and I don't have a lot of close friends/confidants.","Help] Stress/Anxiety is making me sick Hey r/Stress, I am not too sure if this is the correct place to post this, but give me a read and if its not I will find the correct place to go.

"I’m really losing it, and I can’t afford therapy right now","Sorry if this is long. I genuinely have no one else to talk to, and I’ve never opened up to anyone about this. My parents are also between jobs so they neither have the insurance nor the money to afford a therapist. I’m 22 years old, in my last year of my doctorate (I skipped many grades), and I’ve even passed difficult international business exams recently. But life just hurts. I feel like I’ve always pushed myself beyond limits because if I stop, I’ll go back to wanting to kill myself. I have ‘friends,’ but for the last 7 years I’ve always had to pretend to be happy, so none of them really know me. I’ve always been the one person in the room who was just never having fun, always wanting to go back home, crawl in my bed, and have dark fantasies about being hurt enough to finally make the ultimate decision. I can’t open up to anyone because no one knows how to react to my depression, let alone my suicidal mindset. I’ve tried some meds for a month, and it helps slightly, but I’m so ashamed of taking them. I haven’t refilled my prescription, and I don’t intend to. I refuse to be dependent and weak. I’m writing because after several years, I’ve noticed behaviors in me I never had before. 2 months ago I had something hurtful happen to me socially, and since then I’ve been hitting myself and screaming “FUCK YOU” to myself when I’m driving with my thoughts. I have no energy, but I keep working. My efficiency is only 1/3 of what it should be, but it’s the most I can do to keep going. I’m tired. Even if I could afford therapy, if I tell my therapist that I’m really suicidal at times, I’ll be forcefully admitted into a hospital and my doctorate will be postponed by a year (if that happens I’ll be extremely suicidal). There’s nothing wrong with me physically. I’m average height, no deformities, no issues regarding intelligence. I’m okay… yet I still just want to end things. I also believe it’s absolutely unfair for someone to be in a relationship with me. How could I burden anyone with this. I can’t share this pain, because it’s horrible, and no one should have to deal with this. Not that most girls would anyway. How long could someone realistically stay and help someone who’s self esteem is shattered and can’t ever open up but looks extremely depressed. Anyway, just wanted to let this out anonymously somewhere. Thanks.","I’m really losing it, and I can’t afford therapy right now Sorry if this is long.

A stranger on the beach just gave me money to buy ice creams for the group of young people I was with and walked away,"I'm an Italian volounteer working in France for an association that helps young people without family to get indipendent. They're mostly migrants from Africa and Arab countries that need housing, getting regular documents to legally stay in the country, finish their studies and find a work. Due to Covid we didn't do many activities and we were left with some extra budget, so we decided to spend it for a trip, and yesterday we brought them to the beach. We were a dozen seven teenagers from several african countries, three from Pakistan, me, and an educator. As soon as we arrived we immediately went into the water. Me, being a little thin and suffering the cold from the water more than other people, got out earlier than the others and went back where we left our stuff. Not a minute after I got there, a guy came to me asking something. It went like that Him Are you supervising that group there? (pointing at my young ones playing in the water) Me Yes At that point I expected some kind of bad remark. And instead. Him We are leaving tomorrow, and I wanted to give you this to spend for getting them ice creams And he lent me a 50 euros banknote. I didn't really know what to reply on the spot, and just told him a ""thank you"", very surprised. He didn't wait for more, and just left. He had his towel a little further, he packed his stuff, was joined by who I guess were his wife and daughter, and went away. He didn't ask if I was working for some association, who the young ones I was supervising were, nothing. He didn't even wait for giving the money when everyone was present. He just made this selfless act and departed. On the way back we bought everyone ice creams and I ended the day with a really great feeling. I think it was the nicest, most spontaneous thing I ever happened to see from someone.","A stranger on the beach just gave me money to buy ice creams for the group of young people I was with and walked away I'm an Italian volounteer working in France for an association that helps young people without family to get indipendent.

I’m gonna blow a gasket,"I’m a male, 16 years old and a junior in high school. I go to a private college prep school with very, very, very challenging work. It’s only been a week of school and I’m already shaking from stress and I’m on the verge of having a breakdown every day. I yelled at my girlfriend for the first time since we started dating almost 5 months ago in a fit of frustration and I immediately burst into tears. I’m having to sacrifice 2-3 hours a night to homework after 7 hours of school and I can’t stand it. I’m dropping AP U.S history (which I thought I was looking forward to) because of how much work it is. But even without APUSH I’m still swamped with work in all my classes. My grades are already dropping, and I barely have time to do the things that actually bring my any sort of happiness. And I feel so weak because of it. Everyone else is just carrying on like it’s no big deal. They know it’s a lot, and they push forward. They take the challenge head on and make it through. They actually contribute to classes unlike me who just sits there silently freaking out and taking notes to save my life. And I’m not even in as many hard classes, nor do I do as many extracurricular activities as some of, if not most of my peers. Some people even poked fun at me when I said I was thinking about dropping AP U.S History. I feel like such a Goddamn quitter and an idiot. But this is just too much for me. I came home every day last week super frustrated and stressed. It’s only been one week. I don’t know if so can deal with 9 months of this without having a huge mental breakdown. I’m so close to blowing a gasket. I hope I’m in the right place to let all this anxiety and frustration out.","I’m gonna blow a gasket I’m a male, 16 years old and a junior in high school.

Can you be stressed without even knowing it,"Hey everyone I am just curious can you be stressed or anxious without even knowing it. For example for the last 3 weeks I had this tingling feeling around my chin and bottom lip. So I did the number 1 no no and googled it, well according to google I might have advance cancer and dying in less then a year. That caused me to stress out and think what if I am not around for my kids to see my kids grow up. So I called the doctor and I have an appointment with him on Tuesday but he sent me to get a blood test in advance which all came up perfect except for cholesterol levels. So after the blood test results I think my anxiety lowered but every often I still feel the chin tingling. So back to the question can you be stress or anxious on something without realizing. Thanks for the advice Just an update my doctor doesn’t think my chin is anything even though I still feel the tingling feeling even now. He said give it another month and then we will go for an mri. Is it possible that stress of me worrying has been causing this symptom and if so it cannot be healthy having stress symptoms for like a month Thanks for the advice","Can you be stressed without even knowing it Hey everyone I am just curious can you be stressed or anxious without even knowing it.

I need to find a way to calm down,"I´m unsure about what is going to happen to me. I have two jobs, one part-time, and one full time. The problem is, I might have been kicked out of my part-time job (it´s a job from home), because an email that was supposed to arrive three days earlier arrived only this morning. For my full time job, I might have to leave it after this summer ends. I´m starting my university, and my contract might not be switched to a part-time one, because the company is slowly losing it´s money, and my boss might not be willing to keep me in there. And now I´m unsure about my future. My mom is moving out at the end of the year, so I have to find a way to work while I´m going to study at an university, and a way to pay my bills, and a new place to live at. On top of that, I haven´t been with my girlfriend in three months due to my tight work schedule. And I also need money to save up money for a ton of stuff for the university. If I´m getting kicked out of my full time work at the end of the next month, then I have only about 900€ to survive with until the end of year. My family is unwilling to help me, because nobody has a place for me to stay at, or the will to help me financially. My heart is racing, I feel heavy. I don´t know what the fuck should I do to easy this stress. I´ve tried watching Shia LaBeouf screaming in front of a greenscreen, I´ve tried watching Bob Ross, I´ve tried ASMR, I´ve tried smoking, but nothing helps. I don´t want to go back to alcohol, because let´s be honest, I can´t afford it. What should I do? How do I calm down? EDIT 1 So, I wasn´t kicked out of the job, my account just got somehow blocked on the page during the process of my supervisors reviewing my work. This morning, my boss responded to my email, and told me that I have two options; I could quit the job or I could stay, but I´d have to be re-trained (I review newspapers as my part time job) and I´d have to work even more, because reviewing 300 pages of newspapers wasn´t enough (he told me that I need to review at least 2000 pages a month). He was very understanding and wasn´t menacing or awful about it. He said that he understands that I might have a time restrain or that I might not feel like doing the job. I agreed to his offer to pay me this month´s work, and I´m now waiting for his response. So yes, I´ve had to quit the part time job. A big stone fell of my heart, as I now have my time for my hobbies back (making music, recording videos, gaming, reading). Also, for my full time job, it was confirmed that I wouldn´t be kicked out. And, because I am at the end of my two months testing period, I´m allowed to take vacation, so now I will have time to go get signed up for my university, and to finally, after two months, go to a lot of doctors (I have a lot of skin problems, my eyesight and colorblindness are getting worse, and maybe even seeking out psychiatric help for my stress, anxiety and depression issues). Turns out, all I needed to do was just to vent to my girlfriend. She was very understanding about my situation, and is very supportive.

Finals Week,"Bit of a rant - just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same (excuse the word vomit, i've been up since 6 30 AM for an exam). It's finals week and anxiety/stress is at an all time consistent high. On top of that, our family puppy has been great but I think my school anxiety has trickled in to me worrying over him more than I should, and I constantly get overwhelmed with all the things I have to get done. I can't even enjoy food because I am always thinking too much and get caught up in the stress of school. I literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping, and I immediately said ""wow he's depressed isn't he"" when he's just SLEEPING. I went out to get food, totally fine, no problem. As soon as I got home it hit me again with all the stuff I have to do. The pandemic has 1000% affected my mental health especially recently, where I don't get any enjoyment of stuff at home because I am always in front of a damn computer screen. I used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school, and now I see home as the place where I do everything and there's no distinction between relaxing and school. But - the one thing I can hold onto is that it is going to PASS. All of this is going to pass at some point, the brain is just rewiring itself because of the situation happening globally. It's going to be okay, the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. If this spoke to anyone out there, feel free to let me know how you're feeling. How are you coping? \*\*And if there's any puppy pros in the crowd, please let me know what you did to help release some of that feeling of wanting constantly to helicopter over them during times of stress. When I feel relieved, I don't feel any need to check on him constantly or obsess over little things around the house, just when I am overwhelmed; and then, I don't get anything productive done anyways. I always remind myself I am not alone - and neither are you. Even talking to strangers about it can be soothing in a way, just a little reminder that there's someone else out there in your boat during such a difficult time.

I want to cry. I feel like the dumbest person in the world.,"I’m 25 and currently taking a college precalculus course at community college so that I can have a better future. I grew up poor and getting a good education is a way for me to break free from poverty. I’ve been acing all my classes up until this class which I currently have an 89% in but I have a feeling it might drop significantly due to the fact that I don’t understand the 2 chapters that we were taught. I have a 2 chapter exam and a finals back to back in 12 days since this class is a summer math course and is only 4 weeks. We are currently learning matrices and I just don’t get it no matter how hard I try. We were supposed to be taught how to do this since middle school and high school algebra but of course I went to a pretty bad school and was never taught how to do basic row echelon forms. I feel so left behind compared to the rest of my class. Everyday I study for more than 5 hours and I just cannot pick things up. I go to tutoring sessions, ask professors and students for help and I just can’t understand this chapter. I’ve tried YouTube videos and even performing problems on my own, but it just causes this overwhelming feeling in my brain which I cannot really describe. I wake up at 5am to prepare for this class on top of going to work. My parents are very stressed and tired and I just want to excel in school, make them proud, and take care of them in the future. Right now, I am so scared my GPA will drop since I want to transfer into a good school. I wish I did better in high school so I don’t have to deal with going to school as an adult.","I want to cry.

Trying to succeed in college when you’re depressed fucking sucks.,"Everyone says “try harder” or “I know you can do it” and all I wanna say to them is shut the living fuck up. I can’t try harder and I can’t do it, if I could I obviously would. I know they care but they’re also being inconsiderate by assuming I’m just choosing to fail my classes. I’ve been struggling with depression for a few years, I feel the lowest I’ve ever felt right now. I’ve in therapy and I take meds and I still can’t handle all the pressure and responsibilities of living. Depression kills / *edit* Wow, I did not expect this to reach so many people. I have read any single kind comment everyone has left, sorry if I haven’t replied immediately I’m trying. I really appreciate every beautiful soul giving me words of encouragement. For anyone going through the same bs as I am, I just wanna let you know it’ll get better. I feel as you do, so hopeless and tired. But this is the moment we need to preserve more than ever. I wish everyone to sees this the best of luck in your battle against the fights life throws at you. <3","Trying to succeed in college when you’re depressed fucking sucks.

Stressful day,"Spoiler alert this post is mostly venting, but any advice or kind words are appreciated. After 4 days of waking up unwillingly early in the morning and being unable to sleep again, this morning I woke up with a chest on my stomach and tingling in my lungs when breathing deeply, as well as general malaise (body pain, not-clear mind, but no fever or bad cough or else). Last weekend I went out for lunch with a couple friends who recently recovered from Covid, and I have also seen my (paternal) grandparents and another couple friends since, besides sharing every meal with my parents. My other grandpa (91 y.o.) - still not vaccinated against Covid19 - is coming back from the hospital tomorrow after undergoing surgery for a tumour and my parents will go there to help set him up, as he'll require care. I am not only unable to go help them, but also hit with anxiety of potentially having contracted Covid and having passed it to them, as well as to my other grandparents and/or friends (who, thanks goodness, are all vaccinated). Plus, I am writing my PhD thesis, which I need to deliver in a month, and I've got no time to waste being sick. I could postpone, but I'd rather not. Plus I haven't seen my (long-distane) boyfriend in a month, he's supposed to pass by for a few days in a couple weeks and I really need to see him, so much that my feverish mind, spinning thoughts at 200 km/h, was thinking how much I'd want to fuck him holding him against the wall and suck his dick (at least some good thoughts). Plus, my bf and I collaborate on a research projects, and another of our co-authors suggested inviting another senior professor to work on the project with us, which would help our chances to publish it in a good journal, but might reduce our contribution to it. I know he and I have somewhat different views on how to manage this issue, but I should decide about it soon and I don't feel clear-minded enough to do so. Plus, I have been somewhat down in the past months (better now) and tend to be needy at times, so I am also concerned that letting him know I really miss him and need him might make me less attractive in his eyes, and he acknowledged he's not very skilled at offering support to me in this instances. I have booked a Covid test for tomorrow at noon and hope it will go well, but anyway better know one way or the other. I just hope (and know) that everything will turn out fine one way or another, but I really do feel alone and stressed... not even unable to cope with things, because I know I can do it, but I'd just wish it were easier to get some much-needed support, especially from my bf who is the most important person I'd want to rely on. Wishing for a brighter tomorrow, and glad to hear any advice you might have on how to better cope with things. As mentioned, I have been feeling vulnerable and easily taken down in the past months due to a combination of factors (Covid, job-related rejections, ...), I am picking myself up but sometimes it still feels hard to cope with all the shit (which, objectively, is not even that bad, given the much bigger problems that many people are facing these days).","Stressful day Spoiler alert this post is mostly venting, but any advice or kind words are appreciated.

Parentified parent with severe depression,"Im a 31 male and at this point Id be glad if someone or something would take my life. It all wen't rapidly downhill after I got my first child, who is a wonderful little boy, now so similarly vital and full of life and energy like I was when I was little. Everybody used to go jesus christ the energy on that boy! I mean everybody. Now I feel dead for a long time and next to the current situation I feel even worse. I was physically parentified by my father - fulfilling his beliefs and standards and taking care of his needs when he was terminally ill with leukemia. For 15 years he held me responsible for him and as a buffer between my brothers and my mother (I'm the eldest). I was emotionally parentified by my mother who couldnt deal with the pain and anxiety of raising children so young and losing herself and doing that with a man with so many problems himself - my father was violent, distant, controlling, bullying etc. Constantly needing my emotional support since I was 6. I realized that this is fucked up when I was 27 and started to notice and address my problems after such an upbringing, while being supportive of both of my brothers who ended up in suicidal depression for a while and in addition dealt with my mom who almost died and was in a coma for a while. I had a few longterm relationships until now where I never wanted to move in with another person cause I've never had enough personal space myself. The relationship I'm in now started 3years ago, we moved in together and that led to suicidal depression at the end of the first year. So I managed to crawl out somehow, but to realize my adolescent years were all in a depressive haze and I never managed to truly find myself and be myself and fully enjoy life as a young person or as a child. Now, after the baby, I feel so alone, so tired and so failed. Finally there's a family I would like to take care of because I want to this time - its my own son and I love him so much, but I've been stuck taking care of my other-family and now I'm just so wasted - mentally and physically. If I'm home, I'm anxious and dont have any personal space and nothing to do just for myself. When I'm at work I fucking hate everybody there cause I didnt have the time to get the hell out of there, which is financially almost impossible now. I loose connection with my mainly single friends who I despise now in a way and I fucking hate everybody else on the streets, traffic and anyone who wants to interact with me. With the kid I see my previous family a lot aswell which is so tiring. I have a small rented room for myself for which I dont have any time to go to or if I'm there I just cry and watch the clock to get back in time to deal with baby chores. So I feel stuck in the same demonic mental state like with my previous family, adding the love and responsibility for my child, which makes it impossible to say ""grow up, I'm out of here!"" My woman is in a similar burnout state, so not much support from there - its the oppisite - I feel I should be the one to support her and I can see how devastating it is for her when i break down which causes in turn so much blame for myself. All of which drains me of the little energy I have left - so now i'm in full suicidal mode again and not able to do any of these things mentioned and no time to do anything I known I need to do for myself to be sane which makes me think why bother at all anymore? On top of that I'm ill aswell atm so a total wreck... I just needed to get it out.

life is a chore,"Having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of *I have to do this all over again.* Have to go to school, college, university or even work, we're stuck in our imaginative sociable, unsociable life.

I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f),"This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do. Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared. I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst.

"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive","Hi y’all, Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them. I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since. I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post. So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her. When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy. She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually. We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other. Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual. But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her. We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life. We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy. When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way. We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence. She was a very funny person as well. She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate when she did something she put her whole heart into it. She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that. But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence. I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter. My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me. She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again. Everyone loved her, literally. She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people. She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive. I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world. We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved. But I cannot bear what happened. We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way. No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh. It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together. On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more. It’s absurd I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself. It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine). I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout. Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown. But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either. I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this. I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey. Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her. People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day. Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me. The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more). I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it. For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer. I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.","I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive Hi y’all, Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them. I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since. I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post. So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her. When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy. She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually. We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other. Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual. But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her. We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life. We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy. When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way. We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence. She was a very funny person as well. She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate when she did something she put her whole heart into it. She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that. But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence. I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter. My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me. She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again. Everyone loved her, literally. She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people. She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive. I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world. We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved. But I cannot bear what happened. We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way. No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh. It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together. On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more. It’s absurd I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself. It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine). I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout. Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown. But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either. I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this. I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey. Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her. People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day. Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.

"I need help, I don't know what to do","This is a throwaway account. I'm utterly embarrassed with myself. I'm young and have so much I feel like I can accomplish. I'm sitting here at work, writing this, and currently having on of the worst days of my life. I feel alone. I feel unable to connect. I am isolated. I feel like nobody understands. I don't blame anyone for not understand. Maybe I'm wrong. I just want to feel better, to feel connected. I want to care about something other than myself. I don't even know where to begin. I am in a position where I believe there is so much negativity in my life, it effects my internal optimism. the real me is so much different than me. I don't know how to explain that. I don't know if others feel that way too. Theres the 'you' who tries to be compassionate, and caring. But then deep down, there's a different you. I have such a hard time expressing myself because I feel like nobody cares how others feel. You know why I feel like this. I don't care how others feel, well I Kinda do. Let me put it like this. Let's say there is a guy I know called bob. He tells me about his problems, and how hard is life is. I tell him that really sucks, and I understand what I'm going through. And suddenly he feels better, now that he's had someone to vent to. But the reason I'm trying to comfort him is not because I care about his issues, I don't understand the pain he is going through. The reason I comfort him is because I understand that connecting to someone in that way can be relieving. It makes you feel like your not the only one going through that. But what if that's just what everyone does. That's how i feel about venting. Even though I'm sitting here typing to you, you probably don't care. And even though you may write something that is supposed to be comforting, it's not. I don't believe you, I can't honestly believe that, the person you're talking to, that you actually care for that person. I don't know if that's true or not, but my deep down me say's it is true. I've contemplated several reasonings to why I feel so.... I don't know how to describe it. I don't trust anyone but myself. I cannot express enough how hard it is for me to put these feelings into words. When I was growing up, I had terrible parents. No they didn't hit me, or physically abuse me. They didn't play with my mind or do some of the terrible things you hear about. So why do I say there were terrible parents. They weren't there. They were, but they weren't. All I ever remember is my mother coming home after we went to bed. I remember my dad sitting in his room watching T.V. We never went out. We never vacationed. I don't feel like I know those people. I feel isolated. Once I reached high school things changed a bit. My parent's split to no surprise from anyone. My dad and I lived together and got somewhat closer. I wanted to live with my mom, but my sister did too. And I didn't want my dad to have to live alone. My dad was going through a deep depression at the time. We would both stay home at night. We didn't do anything. I got the new COD black ops. I start skipping school. Nothing feels good, nothing feels right. I just want to play video games, it's the only thing that takes me away. it's the only thing I look forward too. I start skipping more. I never make it to class after lunch anymore. Principal calls my dad to setup a meeting. I've missed over 80 days of school. I'm not going to be a freshman next year. I used to be a straight A student in middle school. I still think I could be. I go through half of sophomore year with the same exact issues. Still skipping school. I know it's not the right thing to do, but I hurt. I don't care, I want to escape. We move across the country for a new start. My dad and I move in with his mother. My grandpa recently passed, so she was quite lonely. Also, my dad is a mama's boy for sure, so this helped him out too. I went to a new school, had a new start. I meet somebody the first of day. she came up to me and started talking. this is the first time anyone has ever reached out to me like that. I feel different. I feel confident. Maybe people do like me. Turns out we go to the same church, we're in the same ward, the same classes. She is amazing. I meet another guy, he's so cool. He's extremely outgoing and we also go the same church, the same school, have some of the same classes. Both of them start dating. I am absolutely crushed. I feel alone, I thought i found some people I could connect with, but then puppy love takes over and once again I'm ignored. I meet her best friend. She's kind of cute, and she really likes me. Ok what the hell let's give it a shot. We start dating, i think i like her. Let's makeout, and hangout. We should have sex, sex is so cool. Oh you don't want to? that's okay we can just start slow. Everytime she comes over it's the same thing, puppy love. She starts to take notice that the relationship is very one-sided. I'm oblivious. I want sex, I want attention, I want to feel normal. But I can't take this stress she is causing me. We're over, I'm done with you. I don't feel bad about it. Then my two new friend that were together break up. I don't want to step on my friends toes so I don't make any moves. But she's amazing, I actually care for her. We start hanging out everday when they breakup. I want to be with her. I feel like at times she feels the same, but at other times there's nothing. She starts smoking cigarettes and this destroys me. She is relieving stress and I don't care, i just want to be there with her. Things escalate, we get very close, i feel like i can tell her anything. Things heat up sexually, we constantly tease each other. Then she got a job and everything changed. She met a guy. We weren't official or anything but i thought we were close. I just don't know how to express how I feel to her, and i feel like i'm a backup to her. Maybe i was, maybe i wasn't. She start's dating this new guy. He's a bad influence, he smokes and drinks, and he's been to jail. But the thing is care for her, and I don't want to stand in the way of them being together. So we revert back to friends. There's no issue between us three, they let me hang out with them whenever. The guy likes me, we smoke together. One night they were at a park drinking. They wanted to go home, and he got in his truck. He hit someone, they were instantly killed. He's running from police, She gets out of the car. He crashes into a park. I can't believe it. She's pregnant. I can't deal with this. A girl I work with tells me about a stoner friend she has. She thinks we would like each other. The three of us decided to hang out that night. Everything goes real smoothly, I genuinely enjoy this girls company. The three of us go to my house and watch some movies, I get her friends number. I invite her to hangout that night again. She sneaks out and comes over to my house at late at night. We're hanging out and she makes a move. Things escalate and next thing I know my virginity is gone. It is clear she had already lost hers. Our relationship quickly turns sexual, she want's to fuck all the time. I'm not looking for sexual relationship deep down, but the cool me (that I want everyone to know and like) does want to fuck. It's cool, it's what happy people do. This is a normal relationship. We get walked in on doing oral by her moms boyfriend. He hates me, I'm a bad influence on her. We keep seeing each other, I start to really like the nonsexual part of our relationship. Her parent's aren't home and I go to see her. She has to meet up with them in a few hours, and they won't be coming home until after that meetup. Uh oh, someone just came home, quick hide next to my bed. I have to leave right now, don't worry whoever just came home is probably leaving soon too, just leave after they leave. So there I lay, waiting for them to leave. Suddenly the door opens, it's the boyfriend. He checks the room and finds me. He doesn't let me leave, he say's I'm trespassing. I tell him I was invited in and told to hide there. He doesn't believe me, he doesn't let me pass. I try to push my way through and he threatens to call the cops. This is bullshit. I push through him and run downstairs to leave. Fuck her, I can't believe she put me through that. She should've taken the heat. I start developing anxiety from that experience. I've never had anxiety. I didn't know anxiety existed until that point. I never want to hear from her again, but i really liked her. I need to get out of here. Fuck this place, fuck this town. I'm tired of it. I want to move back to where I came from, at least I know area. And hey, weed is legal there so at least I got something that will help me. So I tell everyone that I'm leaving, nobody tries to stop me. I have $300 in savings and plane ticket. I have no where to stay. I just know I want to leave. I'm saving goodbye to some friends and my brother comes down. We're half brothers, and his dad was black so he drives down to hang out with me. I didn't know this at the time, but he's running from the cops. He was a warrant out in our home state. He waits outside my house at the park next door till I wakeup to tell me that he's here. Someone calls the cop to complain someone is trying to take a bath in the community pool. He was sitting a couple 100 feet away from the pool doing nothing. The cops show up and he tells the officer that he is waiting for me. I learn that someone called the cops on him for sitting in the park. Those fucking racist neighbors, just because he's black doesn't mean he's homeless. I talk to the cop but deny him being my brother at first, because I didn't want to identify myself, I was scared. The cop harasses both us, one of us is lying, but we committed no real crime so he let's us go. I say hey let's go smoke some weed with my friend. So I drive his car over to my friends house and we light up. Then we decided to go to my other friends house. So we leave my friends neighborhood. We're being followed, but i didn't realize this at the time. We get to a three way intersection, I take a right and pull into the second lane because I have to take an immediate left after. I pull over to next to the side walk and park. I start unbuckling and next thing I know there is a cop next to my window. He yells at me to roll down the window. The window doesn't work. I try to yell this through the door, he tells me to open the door. I comply, I am literally shaking. We have dabs in the car and a little bit of bud. I'm scared. He says he smells marijauna as soon as I open the door. Bullshit, he's lying. The bud is in a mason jar, and the dabs have no smell unless your nose is right up to it. He takes everyone out of his vehicle and starts by harassing me. I know you have weed in there, so just let me know where it is and this will all be over. We don't mind calling the K-9 unites to search your car, and we probably won't stop them if they try to bite you in the ass. I tell them where everything is, I was scared. They start harassing my brother. ""We don't want your kind in this city. Leave and do not come back"". He is black, is that the kind your talking about? are you fucking kidding me right now? do you fucking hear yourself? We're taken into custody and driven to the police station, they take our pictures tell us how wrong we were. No we weren't doing anything wrong, you guys profiled us and followed us out of one of the poorest neighborhoods in a very wealthy city. You harassed us and assumed we had weed on us, despite any evidence other than coming out of a poor neighborhood. Doesn't matter, I have a plane ticket and I'm already leaving. I arrive in this new city and hit up a craiglist contact I reached out to earlier. We're in similar positions, he's a year older just moved to Chicago. He's very forward about the fact that he is homosexual.we'll call him bradley. Okay no problem. I figure he realizes I'm not interested. He offers me a place to stay with im for $300. Perfect, that's all I have. I get a job at a local pizza place, it's perfect cause I can make tips to help me until next paycheck. Now I have no money. Turns out it's not his house, but we're sharing his room in a house which other people from chicago. the other people are great, but they hate bradley. bradley is a douche. bradley suggest I might be a closet homosexual. He will have sex with me if I want, but he let's me know he would be the top. He tells other people that I'm actually a 32 year old pretending to be 19. He tells other people I'm hiding my homosexuality. He constantly describes homo sex to me. I don't want to hear about it. I tell him I don't care who he likes, what gender he is, I don't want to hear about his sex life. He continues to harass me sexually. I ask the other roommates if I can take the extra room upstairs, I'll pay for a fair share of the rent. They all hate bradley and they agree. It's a shitty house, and I want to move out. I want to move closer to work. I isolate myself further, all these new people, this is a new life. I'm on my own now. Nobody is going to help me. I find a roommate and we get a small apt to share. I quit the pizza place after some bullshit that I'm over with. Bad management that blames the staff for everything. Just one example there was a busy Wednesday night where I was the only server. The ice cream machine breaks and I'm usually the one to fix it. I don't have time as I am serving everyone. I'm supposed to clean it every night. We usually have two servers on a busy night like this. I finally finish serving and cleaning up and at that point it's midnight. I have to back at 1pm the next day for lunch rush. I'm exhausted from covering another server's shift. I put a note on the ice cream machine not to turn it on, as it is broken. Skip forward to 8 am when the owner blows up my phone because the ice cream machine wasn't cleaned properly last night, and once he turned it on ice cream starting spilling everywhere. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? CAN YOU FUCKING READ???? I come in to see the damage and I see the note still on the ice cream machine. He say's he saw the note, but doesn't tell me anything more than that. He didn't tell me why he decided to turn it on regardless of the note. He yells at me for not staying later than I did even though I already worked an hour and a half past my get off time, while working two fucking shifts. Long story short, his wife told me she didn't have time to fix my paycheck with 10 overtime hours fucking missing off my paycheck. fuck you bitch, you don't deserve me as an employee and I walk out. I then find the job opportunity of my life, a web design firm is hiring. Okay awesome, let me just apply and show them all my awesome skills. I walk in to the interview, everything is brand new, everyone is dressed super nice, everyone is super young. I start and 3 days after being hired, my supervisor is fired for nodding out. I should've seen this sign and left right then and there. The owner starts talking to me more and more. He gives me special jobs, and has talks with me all the time. It's clear he is doing some sort of drugs. Over the next few months, and many raises later things start going really downhill. This guy starts playing mind games with everyone. Someone is stealing is leads. Someone is always out to get him. He want's to know who is stabbing him in the back. He set's up elaborate traps to catch people in the act. He ends up accusing me of stealing leads. That's impossible, I would never do that. He set's it up so that I end up blaming another one of his top guys. But if you look at all the evidence HE PLANTED, he made it look like it was that guy who was stealing the leads. So then he accuses me because of the accusations I made about his TOP guy. This is some bullshit. He calls me that night because he want's me to admit to it. I go off him, I've never felt so betrayed in my life, I told him how bullshit it is that he is accusing me of lying to him. He just lyed to me about all the evidence that made me accuse the other guy. He say's it's gonna be ok, and he forgives me. He just want's me to tell him that it was me and it will all be over. NO FUCK YOU, it wasn't me. go fuck yourself. He contacts me the next day when I don't show up for work. He says come hangout with me, I just want to talk. We go to the bank with another guy and spend a couple hours there opening up a new business account. Everything is going fine, I'm explaining to him how betrayed i felt. He apologizes and says it won't happen again. Then he decides he will take me home. He pulls over the side of the road on the way home, and crushes what appears to be 2 30mg percs, and 2 lines of cocoa. Snorts that shit right up. on the side of the fucking road. I feel unsafe, I want to leave this company, never see this guy again. And I do leave, fuck this industry. I want to make my own company. And what do you know, I isolate myself deeper. I can't trust anybody, they will just end up fucking you. I get 3 other friends together as business partners. The only way I can describe the next 6 months, is us 'pretending' to be a company. It's like when you were five and playing company with your little five year old friends. We had meetings, and sale pitches, and presentations to potential clients, but we never actually did any 'real' nitty gritty work. We played company for six months, took in over $40k and spent all of it. Every customer charged back on us for not doing anything, and that company went bankrupt very quickly. At this point I had wasted a significant portion of savings trying to survive. So now I was slightly in debt, with no job. Only thing to do is to start my own company. MY OWN. I'm the boss. I take everything i learned from my previous experiences. I rely on already established relationships for work. I get enough freelance work to support myself and the company. I'm working over 50 hours a week just to keep my company afloat. It's worth it to me. I don't want anyone taking advantage of me. I'm done with the bullshit. I'm done with people fucking me. I'm done. So how does this all affect me now? Why do I feel more lost than I ever have been? You know how someone is knowledgeable in a subject. It's when they realize that no matter how much they study, and learn. They'll never learn everything about the subject. That realization in a person shows wisdom in that subject. Maybe that's how I feel about life at this point. I'll never truly get the point I want to be at, and the reason I know that is from all the past experiences I've had. I'm scared. I'm anxious. I'm stressed. I'm alone. I don't know how to connect with anyone. I don't trust anyone. I'm alone. I'm isolated. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. Nobody in my life at the moment is my age. There is nobody I can come home to. No friends or girlfriends. Nothing. I'm Alone. I work more hours than I want to. I'm dying. I didn't take care of my teeth as an adolescent. My teeth are practically falling out. I have three molars that have practically decayed, but i don't have enough money to do anything about it. I'm still recovering from the debt I have accrued. My car literally broke down two days ago after just fixing it. I literally haven't even paid off my last car bill.cost me $700, which put me into debt again. Now I need to pay around another $1000 just get it drive-able again. There is nobody to tell this too. Nobody is willing to help me. I'm going to lose my clients not being able to transport myself to their places of business. I'm fucked. I got fucked. I'm absolutely alone. If you have read this far, I want you to know I'm not asking for money here. Please don't offer. I'm not here for monetary gain. I don't know what I'm here for. I'm sitting at my home office right now and my teeth hurt so fucking bad right now. I wish I could just hug someone right now. anybody. I wish I could feel some level of comfort when all I want to do is to lay down and cry. And as I write what I determine to be the last few thoughts of my ventilation, tears are slowly rolling down my eyes. I don't think I can press submit, but it feels good to have these feelings come out of me. I don't feel like there is anybody I could tell all of this too, which is why I'm writing this right now. I don't want anybody to try and help, I don't know if I can press submit now. It makes me feel like a burden. I don't want to be a burden. I'm just going to do it. Maybe somebody out there can shed some light for me. ","I need help, I don't know what to do This is a throwaway account. I'm utterly embarrassed with myself. I'm young and have so much I feel like I can accomplish. I'm sitting here at work, writing this, and currently having on of the worst days of my life. I feel alone. I feel unable to connect. I am isolated. I feel like nobody understands. I don't blame anyone for not understand. Maybe I'm wrong. I just want to feel better, to feel connected. I want to care about something other than myself. I don't even know where to begin. I am in a position where I believe there is so much negativity in my life, it effects my internal optimism. the real me is so much different than me. I don't know how to explain that. I don't know if others feel that way too. Theres the 'you' who tries to be compassionate, and caring. But then deep down, there's a different you. I have such a hard time expressing myself because I feel like nobody cares how others feel. You know why I feel like this. I don't care how others feel, well I Kinda do. Let me put it like this. Let's say there is a guy I know called bob. He tells me about his problems, and how hard is life is. I tell him that really sucks, and I understand what I'm going through. And suddenly he feels better, now that he's had someone to vent to. But the reason I'm trying to comfort him is not because I care about his issues, I don't understand the pain he is going through. The reason I comfort him is because I understand that connecting to someone in that way can be relieving. It makes you feel like your not the only one going through that. But what if that's just what everyone does. That's how i feel about venting. Even though I'm sitting here typing to you, you probably don't care. And even though you may write something that is supposed to be comforting, it's not. I don't believe you, I can't honestly believe that, the person you're talking to, that you actually care for that person. I don't know if that's true or not, but my deep down me say's it is true. I've contemplated several reasonings to why I feel so.... I don't know how to describe it. I don't trust anyone but myself. I cannot express enough how hard it is for me to put these feelings into words. When I was growing up, I had terrible parents. No they didn't hit me, or physically abuse me. They didn't play with my mind or do some of the terrible things you hear about. So why do I say there were terrible parents. They weren't there. They were, but they weren't. All I ever remember is my mother coming home after we went to bed. I remember my dad sitting in his room watching T.V. We never went out. We never vacationed. I don't feel like I know those people. I feel isolated. Once I reached high school things changed a bit. My parent's split to no surprise from anyone. My dad and I lived together and got somewhat closer. I wanted to live with my mom, but my sister did too. And I didn't want my dad to have to live alone. My dad was going through a deep depression at the time. We would both stay home at night. We didn't do anything. I got the new COD black ops. I start skipping school. Nothing feels good, nothing feels right. I just want to play video games, it's the only thing that takes me away. it's the only thing I look forward too. I start skipping more. I never make it to class after lunch anymore. Principal calls my dad to setup a meeting. I've missed over 80 days of school. I'm not going to be a freshman next year. I used to be a straight A student in middle school. I still think I could be. I go through half of sophomore year with the same exact issues. Still skipping school. I know it's not the right thing to do, but I hurt. I don't care, I want to escape. We move across the country for a new start. My dad and I move in with his mother. My grandpa recently passed, so she was quite lonely. Also, my dad is a mama's boy for sure, so this helped him out too. I went to a new school, had a new start. I meet somebody the first of day. she came up to me and started talking. this is the first time anyone has ever reached out to me like that. I feel different. I feel confident. Maybe people do like me. Turns out we go to the same church, we're in the same ward, the same classes. She is amazing. I meet another guy, he's so cool. He's extremely outgoing and we also go the same church, the same school, have some of the same classes. Both of them start dating. I am absolutely crushed. I feel alone, I thought i found some people I could connect with, but then puppy love takes over and once again I'm ignored. I meet her best friend. She's kind of cute, and she really likes me. Ok what the hell let's give it a shot. We start dating, i think i like her. Let's makeout, and hangout. We should have sex, sex is so cool. Oh you don't want to? that's okay we can just start slow. Everytime she comes over it's the same thing, puppy love. She starts to take notice that the relationship is very one-sided. I'm oblivious. I want sex, I want attention, I want to feel normal. But I can't take this stress she is causing me. We're over, I'm done with you. I don't feel bad about it. Then my two new friend that were together break up. I don't want to step on my friends toes so I don't make any moves. But she's amazing, I actually care for her. We start hanging out everday when they breakup. I want to be with her. I feel like at times she feels the same, but at other times there's nothing. She starts smoking cigarettes and this destroys me. She is relieving stress and I don't care, i just want to be there with her. Things escalate, we get very close, i feel like i can tell her anything. Things heat up sexually, we constantly tease each other. Then she got a job and everything changed. She met a guy. We weren't official or anything but i thought we were close. I just don't know how to express how I feel to her, and i feel like i'm a backup to her. Maybe i was, maybe i wasn't. She start's dating this new guy. He's a bad influence, he smokes and drinks, and he's been to jail. But the thing is care for her, and I don't want to stand in the way of them being together. So we revert back to friends. There's no issue between us three, they let me hang out with them whenever. The guy likes me, we smoke together. One night they were at a park drinking. They wanted to go home, and he got in his truck. He hit someone, they were instantly killed. He's running from police, She gets out of the car. He crashes into a park. I can't believe it. She's pregnant. I can't deal with this. A girl I work with tells me about a stoner friend she has. She thinks we would like each other. The three of us decided to hang out that night. Everything goes real smoothly, I genuinely enjoy this girls company. The three of us go to my house and watch some movies, I get her friends number. I invite her to hangout that night again. She sneaks out and comes over to my house at late at night. We're hanging out and she makes a move. Things escalate and next thing I know my virginity is gone. It is clear she had already lost hers. Our relationship quickly turns sexual, she want's to fuck all the time. I'm not looking for sexual relationship deep down, but the cool me (that I want everyone to know and like) does want to fuck. It's cool, it's what happy people do. This is a normal relationship. We get walked in on doing oral by her moms boyfriend. He hates me, I'm a bad influence on her. We keep seeing each other, I start to really like the nonsexual part of our relationship. Her parent's aren't home and I go to see her.

Fuck her, I can't believe she put me through that. She should've taken the heat. I start developing anxiety from that experience. I've never had anxiety. I didn't know anxiety existed until that point. I never want to hear from her again, but i really liked her. I need to get out of here. Fuck this place, fuck this town. I'm tired of it. I want to move back to where I came from, at least I know area. And hey, weed is legal there so at least I got something that will help me. So I tell everyone that I'm leaving, nobody tries to stop me. I have $300 in savings and plane ticket. I have no where to stay. I just know I want to leave.

At this point I had wasted a significant portion of savings trying to survive. So now I was slightly in debt, with no job. Only thing to do is to start my own company. MY OWN. I'm the boss. I take everything i learned from my previous experiences. I rely on already established relationships for work. I get enough freelance work to support myself and the company. I'm working over 50 hours a week just to keep my company afloat. It's worth it to me. I don't want anyone taking advantage of me. I'm done with the bullshit. I'm done with people fucking me. I'm done. So how does this all affect me now? Why do I feel more lost than I ever have been? You know how someone is knowledgeable in a subject. It's when they realize that no matter how much they study, and learn. They'll never learn everything about the subject. That realization in a person shows wisdom in that subject. Maybe that's how I feel about life at this point. I'll never truly get the point I want to be at, and the reason I know that is from all the past experiences I've had. I'm scared. I'm anxious. I'm stressed. I'm alone. I don't know how to connect with anyone. I don't trust anyone. I'm alone. I'm isolated. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. Nobody in my life at the moment is my age. There is nobody I can come home to. No friends or girlfriends. Nothing. I'm Alone. I work more hours than I want to. I'm dying. I didn't take care of my teeth as an adolescent. My teeth are practically falling out. I have three molars that have practically decayed, but i don't have enough money to do anything about it. I'm still recovering from the debt I have accrued. My car literally broke down two days ago after just fixing it. I literally haven't even paid off my last car bill.cost me $700, which put me into debt again. Now I need to pay around another $1000 just get it drive-able again. There is nobody to tell this too. Nobody is willing to help me. I'm going to lose my clients not being able to transport myself to their places of business. I'm fucked. I got fucked. I'm absolutely alone. If you have read this far, I want you to know I'm not asking for money here. Please don't offer. I'm not here for monetary gain. I don't know what I'm here for. I'm sitting at my home office right now and my teeth hurt so fucking bad right now. I wish I could just hug someone right now. anybody. I wish I could feel some level of comfort when all I want to do is to lay down and cry. And as I write what I determine to be the last few thoughts of my ventilation, tears are slowly rolling down my eyes. I don't think I can press submit, but it feels good to have these feelings come out of me. I don't feel like there is anybody I could tell all of this too, which is why I'm writing this right now. I don't want anybody to try and help, I don't know if I can press submit now. It makes me feel like a burden. I don't want to be a burden. I'm just going to do it. Maybe somebody out there can shed some light for me. ",1,,i need help i dont know what to do this is a throwaway account im utterly embarrassed with myself im young and have so much i feel like i can accomplish im sitting here at work writing this and currently having on of the worst days of my life i feel alone i feel unable to connect i am isolated i feel like nobody understands i dont blame anyone for not understand maybe im wrong i just want to feel better to feel connected i want to care about something other than myself i dont even know where to begin i am in a position where i believe there is so much negativity in my life it effects my internal optimism the real me is so much different than me i dont know how to explain that i dont know if others feel that way too theres the you who tries to be compassionate and caring but then deep down theres a different you i have such a hard time expressing myself because i feel like nobody cares how others feel you know why i feel like this i dont care how others feel well i kinda do let me put it like this lets say there is a guy i know called bob he tells me about his problems and how hard is life is i tell him that really sucks and i understand what im going through and suddenly he feels better now that hes had someone to vent to but the reason im trying to comfort him is not because i care about his issues i dont understand the pain he is going through the reason i comfort him is because i understand that connecting to someone in that way can be relieving it makes you feel like your not the only one going through that but what if thats just what everyone does thats how i feel about venting even though im sitting here typing to you you probably dont care and even though you may write something that is supposed to be comforting its not i dont believe you i cant honestly believe that the person youre talking to that you actually care for that person i dont know if thats true or not but my deep down me says it is true ive contemplated several reasonings to why i feel so i dont know how to describe it i dont trust anyone but myself i cannot express enough how hard it is for me to put these feelings into words when i was growing up i had terrible parents no they didnt hit me or physically abuse me they didnt play with my mind or do some of the terrible things you hear about so why do i say there were terrible parents they werent there they were but they werent all i ever remember is my mother coming home after we went to bed i remember my dad sitting in his room watching tv we never went out we never vacationed i dont feel like i know those people i feel isolated once i reached high school things changed a bit my parents split to no surprise from anyone my dad and i lived together and got somewhat closer i wanted to live with my mom but my sister did too and i didnt want my dad to have to live alone my dad was going through a deep depression at the time we would both stay home at night we didnt do anything i got the new cod black ops i start skipping school nothing feels good nothing feels right i just want to play video games its the only thing that takes me away its the only thing i look forward too i start skipping more i never make it to class after lunch anymore principal calls my dad to setup a meeting ive missed over days of school im not going to be a freshman next year i used to be a straight a student in middle school i still think i could be i go through half of sophomore year with the same exact issues still skipping school i know its not the right thing to do but i hurt i dont care i want to escape we move across the country for a new start my dad and i move in with his mother my grandpa recently passed so she was quite lonely also my dad is a mamas boy for sure so this helped him out too i went to a new school had a new start i meet somebody the first of day she came up to me and started talking this is the first time anyone has ever reached out to me like that i feel different i feel confident maybe people do like me turns out we go to the same church were in the same ward the same classes she is amazing i meet another guy hes so cool hes extremely outgoing and we also go the same church the same school have some of the same classes both of them start dating i am absolutely crushed i feel alone i thought i found some people i could connect with but then puppy love takes over and once again im ignored i meet her best friend shes kind of cute and she really likes me ok what the hell lets give it a shot we start dating i think i like her lets makeout and hangout we should have sex sex is so cool oh you dont want to thats okay we can just start slow everytime she comes over its the same thing puppy love she starts to take notice that the relationship is very onesided im oblivious i want sex i want attention i want to feel normal but i cant take this stress she is causing me were over im done with you i dont feel bad about it then my two new friend that were together break up i dont want to step on my friends toes so i dont make any moves but shes amazing i actually care for her we start hanging out everday when they breakup i want to be with her i feel like at times she feels the same but at other times theres nothing she starts smoking cigarettes and this destroys me she is relieving stress and i dont care i just want to be there with her things escalate we get very close i feel like i can tell her anything things heat up sexually we constantly tease each other then she got a job and everything changed she met a guy we werent official or anything but i thought we were close i just dont know how to express how i feel to her and i feel like im a backup to her maybe i was maybe i wasnt she starts dating this new guy hes a bad influence he smokes and drinks and hes been to jail but the thing is care for her and i dont want to stand in the way of them being together so we revert back to friends theres no issue between us three they let me hang out with them whenever the guy likes me we smoke together one night they were at a park drinking they wanted to go home and he got in his truck he hit someone they were instantly killed hes running from police she gets out of the car he crashes into a park i cant believe it shes pregnant i cant deal with this a girl i work with tells me about a stoner friend she has she thinks we would like each other the three of us decided to hang out that night everything goes real smoothly i genuinely enjoy this girls company the three of us go to my house and watch some movies i get her friends number i invite her to hangout that night again she sneaks out and comes over to my house at late at night were hanging out and she makes a move things escalate and next thing i know my virginity is gone it is clear she had already lost hers our relationship quickly turns sexual she wants to fuck all the time im not looking for sexual relationship deep down but the cool me that i want everyone to know and like does want to fuck its cool its what happy people do this is a normal relationship we get walked in on doing oral by her moms boyfriend he hates me im a bad influence on her we keep seeing each other i start to really like the nonsexual part of our relationship her parents arent home and i go to see her she has to meet up with them in a few hours and they wont be coming home until after that meetup uh oh someone just came home quick hide next to my bed i have to leave right now dont worry whoever just came home is probably leaving soon too just leave after they leave so there i lay waiting for them to leave suddenly the door opens its the boyfriend he checks the room and finds me he doesnt let me leave he says im trespassing i tell him i was invited in and told to hide there he doesnt believe me he doesnt let me pass i try to push my way through and he threatens to call the cops this is bullshit i push through him and run downstairs to leave fuck her i cant believe she put me through that she shouldve taken the heat i start developing anxiety from that experience ive never had anxiety i didnt know anxiety existed until that point i never want to hear from her again but i really liked her i need to get out of here fuck this place fuck this town im tired of it i want to move back to where i came from at least i know area and hey weed is legal there so at least i got something that will help me so i tell everyone that im leaving nobody tries to stop me i have in savings and plane ticket i have no where to stay i just know i want to leave im saving goodbye to some friends and my brother comes down were half brothers and his dad was black so he drives down to hang out with me i didnt know this at the time but hes running from the cops he was a warrant out in our home state he waits outside my house at the park next door till i wakeup to tell me that hes here someone calls the cop to complain someone is trying to take a bath in the community pool he was sitting a couple feet away from the pool doing nothing the cops show up and he tells the officer that he is waiting for me i learn that someone called the cops on him for sitting in the park those fucking racist neighbors just because hes black doesnt mean hes homeless i talk to the cop but deny him being my brother at first because i didnt want to identify myself i was scared the cop harasses both us one of us is lying but we committed no real crime so he lets us go i say hey lets go smoke some weed with my friend so i drive his car over to my friends house and we light up then we decided to go to my other friends house so we leave my friends neighborhood were being followed but i didnt realize this at the time we get to a three way intersection i take a right and pull into the second lane because i have to take an immediate left after i pull over to next to the side walk and park i start unbuckling and next thing i know there is a cop next to my window he yells at me to roll down the window the window doesnt work i try to yell this through the door he tells me to open the door i comply i am literally shaking we have dabs in the car and a little bit of bud im scared he says he smells marijauna as soon as i open the door bullshit hes lying the bud is in a mason jar and the dabs have no smell unless your nose is right up to it he takes everyone out of his vehicle and starts by harassing me i know you have weed in there so just let me know where it is and this will all be over we dont mind calling the k unites to search your car and we probably wont stop them if they try to bite you in the ass i tell them where everything is i was scared they start harassing my brother we dont want your kind in this city leave and do not come back he is black is that the kind your talking about are you fucking kidding me right now do you fucking hear yourself were taken into custody and driven to the police station they take our pictures tell us how wrong we were no we werent doing anything wrong you guys profiled us and followed us out of one of the poorest neighborhoods in a very wealthy city you harassed us and assumed we had weed on us despite any evidence other than coming out of a poor neighborhood doesnt matter i have a plane ticket and im already leaving i arrive in this new city and hit up a craiglist contact i reached out to earlier were in similar positions hes a year older just moved to chicago hes very forward about the fact that he is homosexualwell call him bradley okay no problem i figure he realizes im not interested he offers me a place to stay with im for perfect thats all i have i get a job at a local pizza place its perfect cause i can make tips to help me until next paycheck now i have no money turns out its not his house but were sharing his room in a house which other people from chicago the other people are great but they hate bradley bradley is a douche bradley suggest i might be a closet homosexual he will have sex with me if i want but he lets me know he would be the top he tells other people that im actually a year old pretending to be he tells other people im hiding my homosexuality he constantly describes homo sex to me i dont want to hear about it i tell him i dont care who he likes what gender he is i dont want to hear about his sex life he continues to harass me sexually i ask the other roommates if i can take the extra room upstairs ill pay for a fair share of the rent they all hate bradley and they agree its a shitty house and i want to move out i want to move closer to work i isolate myself further all these new people this is a new life im on my own now nobody is going to help me i find a roommate and we get a small apt to share i quit the pizza place after some bullshit that im over with bad management that blames the staff for everything just one example there was a busy wednesday night where i was the only server the ice cream machine breaks and im usually the one to fix it i dont have time as i am serving everyone im supposed to clean it every night we usually have two servers on a busy night like this i finally finish serving and cleaning up and at that point its midnight i have to back at pm the next day for lunch rush im exhausted from covering another servers shift i put a note on the ice cream machine not to turn it on as it is broken skip forward to am when the owner blows up my phone because the ice cream machine wasnt cleaned properly last night and once he turned it on ice cream starting spilling everywhere are you fucking kidding me can you fucking read i come in to see the damage and i see the note still on the ice cream machine he says he saw the note but doesnt tell me anything more than that he didnt tell me why he decided to turn it on regardless of the note he yells at me for not staying later than i did even though i already worked an hour and a half past my get off time while working two fucking shifts long story short his wife told me she didnt have time to fix my paycheck with overtime hours fucking missing off my paycheck fuck you bitch you dont deserve me as an employee and i walk out i then find the job opportunity of my life a web design firm is hiring okay awesome let me just apply and show them all my awesome skills i walk in to the interview everything is brand new everyone is dressed super nice everyone is super young i start and days after being hired my supervisor is fired for nodding out i shouldve seen this sign and left right then and there the owner starts talking to me more and more he gives me special jobs and has talks with me all the time its clear he is doing some sort of drugs over the next few months and many raises later things start going really downhill this guy starts playing mind games with everyone someone is stealing is leads someone is always out to get him he wants to know who is stabbing him in the back he sets up elaborate traps to catch people in the act he ends up accusing me of stealing leads thats impossible i would never do that he sets it up so that i end up blaming another one of his top guys but if you look at all the evidence he planted he made it look like it was that guy who was stealing the leads so then he accuses me because of the accusations i made about his top guy this is some bullshit he calls me that night because he wants me to admit to it i go off him ive never felt so betrayed in my life i told him how bullshit it is that he is accusing me of lying to him he just lyed to me about all the evidence that made me accuse the other guy he says its gonna be ok and he forgives me he just wants me to tell him that it was me and it will all be over no fuck you it wasnt me go fuck yourself he contacts me the next day when i dont show up for work he says come hangout with me i just want to talk we go to the bank with another guy and spend a couple hours there opening up a new business account everything is going fine im explaining to him how betrayed i felt he apologizes and says it wont happen again then he decides he will take me home he pulls over the side of the road on the way home and crushes what appears to be mg percs and lines of cocoa snorts that shit right up on the side of the fucking road i feel unsafe i want to leave this company never see this guy again and i do leave fuck this industry i want to make my own company and what do you know i isolate myself deeper i cant trust anybody they will just end up fucking you i get other friends together as business partners the only way i can describe the next months is us pretending to be a company its like when you were five and playing company with your little five year old friends we had meetings and sale pitches and presentations to potential clients but we never actually did any real nitty gritty work we played company for six months took in over k and spent all of it every customer charged back on us for not doing anything and that company went bankrupt very

I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples. I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called. Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh. Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this? I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol.","I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time. I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples. I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called. Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh. Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be.

Broke up with my (M23) ex (F23) exactly a year ago and I still can’t seem to cope with the reality and move forwards.,"So I’m not sure if my story would fit the motif of this sub but I can’t seem to find any other places that would help me otherwise, hopefully this would be the place. My ex and I broke up at the end of August exactly one year ago after being in a relationship for two years. We shared the same friend group, studied in the same department, had affections for each other and what meant to happen, happened. Now, I was not a great partner by any mean even though she was everything to me and I blame myself every single day for letting it happen, I completely understood her decision for dumping my ass; it just hurt so much that even after one year, I still can’t move forwards. The whole shenanigan happened during my senior year and it certainly affected my dissertation work very badly. For a few months afterwards, I managed to push myself and come to school regularly to work on my thesis (I worked in a lab for my thesis statement). There were many other issues, parts of it due to the fact that I was not into the academic by any means and I had skipped a whole year previously to work part time jobs just because I disliked the subject so much; this gap year specifically and the differences in academic motivation were big reasons why she dumped me. The other was seeing her and her new partner (she found someone else immediately afterwards, in the same faculty that we were in) on a daily basis and it just hurt my weak ass so much that I would not be able to concentrate at all for the rest of the day. So in order to distract myself from the facts, mostly, I found myself using tinder (it’s kind of a meme where I’m from) hopefully to find a friend, a partner of some sorts. This was going on for a few months, having met a couple of really nice girls, before I realized I was no good to them and what I was doing is selfish and unhealthy, so better off just to keep the affliction to myself and not put it on other people. Now moving forwards, because of that realization in addition with my suffering in school, I decided to quit school entirely, hopefully to come back someday; quit my part time job, not like I was able to work properly anyway; and found myself stuck inside for the past 7 months or so. I also stopped chatting and seeing my friends all together. I share a small friend group of 10, 11 people in college with my ex and that’s about it (I studied high school abroad so no bff around, I’m a dumbbell at keeping contacts as well). She is a regular chatter and I can’t put myself in any further emotional pain, especially when she suddenly decides to talk about her now partner in our group. Now, I’m not an outgoing individual and ever since my failure at studying abroad (I love medicine and was hoping to continue studying abroad after high school, but failed to do so due to financial issues so I’m back in my country doing the complete opposite of what I like), I started to develop a mild condition of depression, it came to my ex’s recognition too but she wanted nothing to deal with it. It finally crossed the line after the break up, in addition to all the stress I got from school and family. I sought a diagnosis earlier this year and was on medication for a few months, though having known the conditions of mental health support in my country and the financial situation my family is in, I relied on the medication alone and it has not helped just one bit. I realize this has been quite a rant and some of you may call me weak, which I agree a hundred and ten percents btw. I just helplessly felt the need to let this pain off my chest and hopefully get some advices in return but otherwise, I truly appreciate your reading and maybe, somehow I can manage to get myself together in the near future, if not, then it was nice knowing you all ). tl;dr high school goals shattered due to financial problem, back to Nam; disliked college and the chosen academic; found a girl, broke up due to differences in academic motivation; fell into depression and have been self-locked inside ever since, found ways to distract myself but to no avail; cut off all contacts and medication is not helping.

I feel helpless and alone.,"I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety since I was 10 years old. It is now 12 years later, and it still has a hold on me. I can’t seem to shake it, the intrusive thoughts and random outbursts of anger or agony. For so long, I tried to pretend like nothing was wrong with me. I lied to doctors about my mental state, I plastered a smile on my face when I knew I was dying inside. I tried to ignore the bullies, and act like they didn’t affect me. I graduated high school and watched my classmates attend their dream colleges. I watched them get into loving relationships. I watched them graduate college, and obtain their dream jobs in the blink of an eye. I continue to watch them as they live a life I could only wish to have. My few friends haven’t talked to me in months. My family does more fighting and yelling than acting like a real family. I want to leave. I want to get away from here, but I don’t know how. I don’t have enough money. I don’t have anyone to turn to. Every single day, I feel more and more helpless. Like no matter what I do, my life will never get better. Sometimes I think I’m one of the unlucky people that don’t deserve a happy ending. It’s unfair. I’m sick of people telling me I need to find my happiness and be more positive. I can’t. It’s not that easy. I cant be positive when every part of me wants to give up. I’m lost, and my biggest fear is that I always will be.","I feel helpless and alone.

Handling my family,"I’m a fifteen yr old male and my older brother (20yr) was recently diagnosed with autism, he is high functioning but has a lot of social issues. I’ve had to rearrange my entire life to cater to his needs now and it’s difficult and for some reason whenever we argue like all siblings do or I argue with my mom they always make me out to be the villain in every situation. Here’s an example, we’ve recently decided to rewatch the entire MCI timeline of movies because we enjoy them, almost every five minutes my brother will point out very minuscule details, at first I had no problem with it but when we got to the iron man movies it went from five minutes to every ten seconds constantly “ohhh that’s that iron man suit number, or is it the other one?ohhhh let me check” and is constantly talking all the other small details that don’t really matter at the moment cause we’re just trying to watch a movie and he’s just rambling so I pause the movie and ask him to stop he says and ok and then just keeps going. This happens around to more times before I snap telling him to just be quiet and watch the movie and then my mother stepped in. Here’s context, earlier when we were watching a different MCU movie my mother was very confused about the plot/story so I said “hey mom can you put down your phone for this scene it explains everything” she nods and watches the rest of the movie joyfully and laughing, now let’s get back to when she stepped in between me and my brother later. She agrees that he needs to settle down but then I’m immediately bombarded with her trying to make me the villain and then asks “what’s so important that you’re looking at you’re phone during the movie?” In a sarcastic And I replied “just looking at my phone, why are you mad at me about it, you did it earlier” and then she snapped now defending my brother, in previous arguments she tends to be very minuscule with details and I always have a retort because most of the time she’s just angry and doesn’t know what she’s talking about and then flips the fact that I rebutted into me being the bad guy in every situation, it gets worse because she’s a hypocrite about it. When I get annoyed and snappy and go down to the same amount of detail that she uses when she argues she gets mad at me, except when she’s the one doing the nit picking and using the small details in her mind it is somehow justified and I shouldn’t be annoyed at her. It seems like a mental trap that I’m always the villain in these situations. Any advice on how to handle this stress? I need it. Edit now that I have left the room because my mother didn’t feel like continuing the movie because I somehow ruined it, she said she was going to sleep. That was a lie because she is now joyfully chatting with my brother, I almost feel like my family is happier without me. Maybe I’m the problem.","Handling my family I’m a fifteen yr old male and my older brother (20yr) was recently diagnosed with autism, he is high functioning but has a lot of social issues.

Meeting a fellow suicidal student in middle school changed my outlook on life. You really never know what's going on with someone. This is a reminder to just be kind when you can because you don't know what's happening under the surface.,"I was reading a post that reminded me of a certain conversation I had with a fellow student back in 7th grade. I was in a lab group with three other kids and this guy who was insanely smart and always cracking jokes rolls up his sleeves. He's got all these scars on them and so another girl in the group asks about them. He just casually tells us he has a cutting problem. His parents had to confiscate knives and things. The rest of the group kind of just was like, ""OK wow that's scary"" and then we just did the assignment. I feel like I missed an opportunity there to help someone out. This guy just opened up about something so personal, and I sort of just was shocked and confused so I didn't comfort him and I didn't say anything touching or kind back. Honestly, I think I just couldn't process it. Was he joking? For me at least, lots of people joked about depression and suicide all the time in middle school. It had never occurred to me that some of these people actually felt that way. When I think back on the whole interaction, I realize I would never have known the internal struggle this guy had even existed if I didn't just happen to be in his lab group and he just happened to roll up his sleeves. I'm also really bothered by the fact that no one was concerned in the group, including myself. Another thing that severely bothers me is the fact that this was middle school. I feel like that's so crazy young and the reality that kids were already facing so much pressure and stress forces me to seriously question what the heck is going on in society right now. The main thing that this has taught me is that you seriously never know what someone is going through. I would never have guessed that this kid hated themselves like that. He was so smart (I kind of was jealous at times) and he made the wittiest jokes 24/7 and he was always smiling. I don't know what has happened to him. I think he switched schools the next year or moved or something. Wherever he is, I hope he's doing well and I hope he's found some real support since our school didn't provide it.","Meeting a fellow suicidal student in middle school changed my outlook on life.

Stress vent/ low key plea for help and advice,"I have no Job at the moment. Over the summer, I started a landscaping company with my partner and things were starting off top notch. When the summer ended, I was starting school after dropping out after 2 years. I dropped out because I had a huge falling out with an extremely close friend of mine. I don’t want to put too much details on what that falling out was, but basically I destroyed his trust in me and not only that I lost literally every friend I had. Me and him where so close together that when shit hit the fan, the other people in our circle stopped talking to me. It took me 2 years to recoup my social loss and all the depression I had. I had tried to commit suicide but failed after saying goodbye to my friends over the phone. They called the police and they came out to speak with me. During this time I also started to delete all my social media. I deleted my twitter account, instagram, and partially my Facebook. I took down all my photos of my face and Unfriended all my close friends (except family because My only means of communication are thru Facebook) Finally during that summer I started feeling like myself again. As if, things could turn for the better instead of the worse. I chose to go back to school to try and put myself back on a good track in life. When I was in school before the events above, I was planning on joining the US Army as a Second Lieutenant. It’s been a dream and passion of mine since I was born. My parents have pictures of me all over the house in army costumes and huge cardboard boxes that I drew on to look like tanks. I felt alive being in that uniform. Especially in college as I joined the university’s ROTC program. Unfortunately as I grew older, my parents health became poorer and poorer. My father has crushed discs in his spine as well as diabetes and early onset dementia. It’s mostly he will forget directions to the store and what he did yesterday or 3 hours ago. But apparently he will soon forget our names. My mom has MS and fibromyalgia on top of PTSD from some trauma she experienced thru her childhood. As well as had extensive surgeries in the past. Both take extremely potent pain killers. My dad is the worst with it. He literally snorts them like coke and does atleast 5-7 a day. My mom has to control how much he takes but there pain is so severe most days there’s no other remedy I can really show them. I tried talking them into medical weed but my parents aren’t interested in the properties and say they won’t work. From there medical history you can tell they don’t have any income except for my oldest brother who is a high functioning autistic adult currently on his Masters Program at the same school I was attending. So financial issues has always been a problem for our family. We don’t have any other family with us. Both my moms side and my dads side hate us for some reason so it’s really just me that they depend on. I have another older brother, but he moved out and hasn’t spoken to any of us in awhile. He calls during the holidays but that’s really the only contact we have. My parents are always...ALWAYS behind the ball on bills and we have had multiple disconnections from the electric company. One time, they didn’t pay for 3 months straight and the bill totaled 866$ on top of reconnection fees. So I had to figure out how to pay all of it because my parents had no earthly idea how to come up with the money. Every month for the past 3 years has been a challenge for money. I’ve worked jobs, stolen things, sold drugs just to keep us up but it’s just never enough. 2 years ago they had a house they where buying and had went behind on the mortgage for almost 6 months. I had no idea because they never told me about it. They lost the house and had to move into a rental. And who took care of that? I did. I’ve been having to care for my sick parents since I graduated high school. I had to put my dreams aside because I couldn’t just leave for the military. They couldn’t even last the couple of months I would be gone for training. So I put my dreams away to try and hustle and work to bring them out. I started looking into ways of making as much money as I possibly can but EVERYTIME I make a breakthrough, something happens like my car breaking down. Or something doesn’t get covered by insurance. And since I stole, it had come back to haunt me which of course I expected. Thankfully I never had to go to court or anything so I’m having to pay a restitution which is too much a month for me to pay and yes I have been missing those payments. I understand the repercussions of those actions but I have to focus my energy on maintaining my apartment which I rent ontop of my parents house which I help pay a portion for as well as the electric and internet. As well as dog food for the dogs, the gas for me and my dads car. A portion of my oldest brothers books, as well as other things here and there to keep them afloat and alive. I am drowning in debt. I went back to school to try and get a business degree this semester. But the age old need for assistance from me came back to haunt me and instead of investing my financial aid from college on some business ideas I had to try and make it ended up going to there bills and mine. When I realized I spent all my grant and scholarship money on bills and not my textbooks and school stuff I just withdrew. No point in going to class unprepared. Also since it’s the fall we have had no business for landscaping so we’ve been short on jobs. I’ve been trying to apply for seasonal work and other jobs but so far it’s been more of a bust than anything good. Now I’m 1 week late on rent for my apartment. I have to come up with close to 1000$ in less than 3 days to pay my rent, my bills and my parents rent and bills. So I’m basically beyond fucked. I could kill myself, but it’s not gonna solve the problem. I just don’t know what to do. And tbh I just wish I can be someone else right now. Like delete this saved game and start new lol. That’s my rant for the day. I don’t expect anyone to respond to this so if you read this and commented.

they where buying and had went behind on the mortgage for almost months i had no idea because they never told me about it they lost the house and had to move into a rental and who took care of that i did ive been having to care for my sick parents since i graduated high school i had to put my dreams aside because i couldnt just leave for the military they couldnt even last the couple of months i would be gone for training so i put my dreams away to try and hustle and work to bring them out i started looking into ways of making as much money as i possibly can but everytime i make a breakthrough something happens like my car breaking down or something doesnt get covered by insurance and since i stole it had come back to haunt me which of course i expected thankfully i never had to go to court or anything so im having to pay a restitution which is too much a month for me to pay and yes i have been missing those payments i understand the repercussions of those actions but i have to focus my energy on maintaining my apartment which i rent ontop of my parents house which i help pay a portion for as well as the electric and internet as well as dog food for the dogs the gas for me and my dads car a portion of my oldest brothers books as well as other things here and there to keep them afloat and alive i am drowning in debt i went back to school to try and get a business degree this semester but the age old need for assistance from me came back to haunt me and instead of investing my financial aid from college on some business ideas i had to try and make it ended up going to there bills and mine when i realized i spent all my grant and scholarship money on bills and not my textbooks and school stuff i just withdrew no point in going to class unprepared also since its the fall we have had no business for landscaping so weve been short on jobs ive been trying to apply for seasonal work and other jobs but so far its been more of a bust than anything good now im week late on rent for my apartment i have to come up with close to in less than days to pay my rent my bills and my parents rent and bills so im basically beyond fucked i could kill myself but its not gonna solve the problem i just dont know what to do and tbh i just wish i can be someone else right now like delete this saved game and start new lol thats my rant for the day i dont expect anyone to

Why am I still stressed out about schoolwork even though school is out for the summer?,"I just went through a prolonged period of stress due to AP exams, interviewing for/working a new job, final projects, SATs, getting behind in schoolwork, getting worse end-of-year grades than usual, and grieving over my pet hedgehog dying (I really loved him and it was really awful when he died). I am not a ""crier"" in any way usually. Up until about a week ago, I couldn't remember the last time I cried. Now, even though that period of stress has passed and it's now summer break, I feel like I could cry at any moment if I wanted to. I can understand that, of course, because I'm still recovering from all that emotional overload, but what I can't understand is why I still feel stressed about SCHOOLWORK specifically. Every time I try and think about planning what I'm going to do this summer, I start to get the same anxiety I feel with schoolwork deadlines, studying for tests, or anything else school related. Even though I try to tell myself that I have no schoolwork left, my brain somehow just doesn't believe me?? I feel like I can't do anything fun this summer because I'm so busy with schoolwork even though I literally have no schoolwork to do at all. Why is this happening and how do I move on so that I can actually enjoy my summer break? It's making me even more anxious and sad thinking about how excited I normally am for summer and how I'm just wasting my summer away feeling absolutely miserable. It's 4 45 am right now and I'm sitting awake in bed writing this because I can't sleep. Help!","Why am I still stressed out about schoolwork even though school is out for the summer?

"Life doesn't ""get better"" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act","Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it. I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*. If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation. It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different. More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore? Edit Thank you for all the comments. I didn’t expect to get any response.

My problem I have no faith in myself,"I have been the same since high school. I work really really hard for everything, because I am convinced that I won't be able to achieve anything if I put a normal amount of effort in. Throughout high school and college, school stressed me out like crazy. I would spend 10's of hours studying for tests instead of just 2-3 like my friends. It would always take me a really long time because a lot of times while studying I would get stressed and not be able to think clearly. My friends would praise me for being able to spend so much time studying and ""being focused"". In reality I was going crazy on the inside. My methods worked, got into an awesome university after high school and also have an amazing job right now. But despite all that I still struggle with believing in myself. I'm convinced I'm stupid and wont be able to solve problems on my own. This past month I really struggled to finish a project. It caused me SO much stress. I lost my appetite, and lost lots of weight because I was always feeling stressed/bad/sad that I wasn't able to finish the project at the pace I wanted and I wasn't able to solve bugs quickly. I know a lot of times the answer is right in front of me when working on code, but just like when I was studying, my mind gets clouded with stress and I can't think or do anything properly. I dread going to work and I am not able to properly enjoy life outside of work either. My bf visited me this past week and I couldn't be happy he was there (even though I hadn't seen him in two months) because of the stress I had in my head. How do I get myself to not be so emotionally tied to work? I can't keep being like this, I know it'll hinder me from being successful. I am currently trying to exercise in the mornings, and meditate for 5-10 minutes. Anyone else have this problem? How did you deal with it?","My problem I have no faith in myself I have been the same since high school.

I have not been diagnosed with any sort of anxiety nor am I going to self diagnose. But it has really become a burden because it takes me half an hour or so to calm myself down, on top of that the class requires cameras to be on and don’t mind it but I will literally be in so much panic and I have to pretend I’m fine on camera because of obvious reasons. I just got out of said class while typing this out and im still on edge and my hands are shaking i just hope this can stop soon because this is a class I can’t get out of doing until next school year..If anyone has any tips or advise I would greatly appreciate it.","Stress during specific classes I’m taking online classes just lake a majority of the population right now and I have 7 classes I am taking, we do A and B scheduling but one specific class stresses me out so much.

Finals and college applications are feeling like too much.,"I'm fully aware that every student encounters stress around the time of finals, but I'm completely overwhelmed. Honestly, I feel cheated as well. All my other friends in public school are skating by in all their classes, talking about how they never have homework, how their finals are so easy, etc. They go out, live it up on the weekends, and spend time with friends. Senior year is supposed to be my time to have fun - the last chance to be a kid before going off to college. I'm stuck at an insanely rigorous private school that assigns me hours upon hours of homework every night and even more over the weekend. Finals are cumulative, meaning students are responsible for every detail of everything we have learned this year. I could understand the reasoning for giving cumulative finals if broad concepts were being tested. However, it's not just broad concepts. It's every date and every battle about which we have learned in history. It's every problem we have done in math, and the same for every other subject. It is all an unbelievable amount of material being required, and I do not truly feel like I can manage it. To make matters worse, I am currently right on the line between letter grades. Doing well on my finals will pull me up, and doing poorly will keep me down. I would not normally be so stressed about finals, but they are a kind of ""make it or break it"" thing at this point, especially because certain colleges require my first semester transcript. I just finished applying to the honors program at the college I will most likely be attending, but I have been so swamped with work all the rest of my life that I'm not even sure I even want to embark on something else challenging. I hear college is the place you make all your true friends, ""find yourself,"" and everything else like that. I just fail to even comprehend this idea because all school has ever posed is stress. It feels like all my LIFE has ever posed is stress. Anyone who survived a rigorous and stressful high school experience, please tell me I'm going to make it. I expect the best of myself and hate myself when I can't deliver. I lose my head when I get too stressed, and I don't even feel like I know what I'm doing anymore.","Finals and college applications are feeling like too much.

I lose my head when I get too stressed, and I don't even feel like I know what I'm doing anymore.",1,,finals and college applications are feeling like too much im fully aware that every student encounters stress around the time of finals but im completely overwhelmed honestly i feel cheated as well all my other friends in public school are skating by in all their classes talking about how they never have homework how their finals are so easy etc they go out live it up on the weekends and spend time with friends senior year is supposed to be my time to have fun the last chance to be a kid before going off to college im stuck at an insanely rigorous private school that assigns me hours upon hours of homework every night and even more over the weekend finals are cumulative meaning students are responsible for every detail of everything we have learned this year i could understand the reasoning for giving cumulative finals if broad concepts were being tested however its not just broad concepts its every date and every battle about which we have learned in history its every problem we have done in math and the same for every other subject it is all an unbelievable amount of material being required and i do not truly feel like i can manage it to make matters worse i am currently right on the line between letter grades doing well on my finals will pull me up and doing poorly will keep me down i would not normally be so stressed about finals but they are a kind of make it or break it thing at this point especially because certain colleges require my first semester transcript i just finished applying to the honors program at the college i will most likely be attending but i have been so swamped with work all the rest of my life that im not even sure i even want to embark on something else challenging i hear college is the place you make all your true friends find yourself and everything else like that i just fail to even comprehend this idea because all school has ever posed is stress it feels like all my life has ever posed is stress anyone who survived a rigorous and stressful high school experience please tell me im going to make it i expect the best of myself and hate myself when i cant deliver i lose my head when i get too stressed and i dont even feel like i know what im doing anymore,0.5,"stress, overwhelm","school, college, test, homework, class, grade, student",none,bet,2,7,0,1

Can stress/anxiety cause a low-grade fever?,"Here’s the story Since September of 2019 my stress/anxiety levels have been off the scale. I was in a car/motorcycle accident with my family & boyfriend. We were all in the truck and physically fine. However there were two people riding the motorcycle that rear ended us. One passed on scene and the other has very very slowly recovered after many surgeries. I dropped down to part time in school, took leave from my serving job and quit my second job during the fall semester and had gone back full time for spring. Id been blessed to had never seen any kind of accident like we did that night. Now, 7 months later I find myself stressing over my normal things. Money, health, family, bills, school, the sound of a motorcycle, however it’s on a totally different scale. I started taking my temp when I feel myself get that shaky, stomach turning stress/anxiety. I’m finding that my temp ends up at 99.6-99.9 when I usually sit at 97.8. I know that doesn’t sound like much but I’m wondering why this is. I plan to soon get professional help after our current pandemic settles. Thank you in advance for advice and explanations!","Can stress/anxiety cause a low-grade fever?

Just want to vent about my stress.,"I moved to a new city for school. No friends. No family. My best friend just moved out of state. University starts in 13 days, I have to study truly immensely to make up for taking last semester off to be able to move here. My dad told me (after years of pressure of importance of college) not to go to school and just do whatever because I was only offered loans. We can barely afford this. I have to get all A's to raise my GPA to get into a better/tougher school that has a free financial aid coverage plan for those who can't afford it ASAP. I work, but need to also get a work study job at University to help with tuition. The rent is expensive out here. More money, more time, but less time studying. I live in this beautiful city, but I have no money. I want to try so many restaurants, I feel so passionate about food lately, it's not about being hungry. I need clothes. I need textbooks. My school parking pass is 150$. My dad wants me to be working a serious professional job within a year, I just turned 21. My family has always had money troubles, my dad was a single parent and worked very hard to take care of me. My mom was young and things were complicated. I just want to make a lot of money and become a professional and take them on vacation. We've never had a vacation before. I'm so stressed, for so long. When my mom tells me she's so proud of me and that she's sorry that it's not easy I just cry. It's overwhelming.","Just want to vent about my stress. I moved to a new city for school. No friends.

Stress is bizarre,"This is the first time in my life I’ve had to deal with real stress. I’m 17, and am leaving for a 5 month volunteer program in two days. I have to fly across the country on my own, where I’ll meet the group of strangers who I’ll be spending the next five months with. This on its own is very, very stressful. I have social anxiety, and I’ll have to leave my family (the longest I’ve been away from my parents is a week). But because I’m leaving in early January, this meant finishing all my classes early. I barely studied over the winter break. I did two tests today, which I think I did okay on. But I have all my exams tomorrow, plus another test. I’m screwed. I’ve been trying to cram all the information I can into my brain, but I feel too fatigued and strained for any of it to even make sense. And I just discovered a new unit of material in the study guide my teacher gave me, which I didn’t even know existed until now. And that’ll be a big chunk of the EXAM tomorrow. I’m bound to end up with a very poor grade, which is in biology, the path I want to pursue in university. How the hell can I imagine getting into university if I can’t even do okay in the high school class? I only identified the issue I’ve been struggling with as being stress a couple days ago. I said before then “ugh I’m stressed out” and whatever, but I didn’t know what that really meant until now. It took a while for me to link the racing mind, insomnia, gastrointestinal troubles, racing heartbeat, restlessness, diffuse concentration, low cognitive performance, disorganization, forgetfulness, and low immune system as all stemming from the same issue until then. I never would have thought these could possibly be related, until I looked up “symptoms of stress” out of curiosity. Damn, every one was bang on.

I’ve been depressed since I was 13 and it’s all because of my parents,Ever since I was a little kid my parents were always toxic and they haven’t really changed much. I was never really allowed to have friends or get too close to anyone for the purpose that “people are bad” which I understand now that people are bad but I feel like the lost sheep and I can’t even socialize and I’m 19. I’ve had depression and depersonalization and anxiety for as long as I can think of. To this day I still do and this is no way of living. I try to have a good relationship with my parents but then I remember all the past times and the feelings resurface. They would always threaten me that if I had fights at school that they would kick me out but in reality people were the ones starting things with me. I had no one to express myself to and my family only made fun of me and told me I was lying. I told them I had a condition called trichotillomania and they denied it and said that I’m lying. I would fill in my eyebrows with makeup because I wanted to hide the spots from where I pulled my hair out. In return I got made fun of and told that I look stupid instead of providing me with professional help of course when I have all these outbursts it’s because I’ve lived my life in humiliation and grief and never did someone offer to help me through the darkest period of my life. I feel like I’ve been living in hell. They have bullied me so much in my life that I can’t even function like a mentally stable person. And I can’t do anything about it because they buy me food and pay for my things so I will be seen as ungrateful and then I will be blamed again. Now I won’t say that I’ve been a perfect child either but growing up I was surrounded by bad and abusive people so I became stubborn and sometimes got into trouble but I was only young and was expected to act like I know everything which is impossible. And a good parent would be better at teaching their child but why expect your child to be perfect when your child lives around parents who fight all the damn time and hit each other But I can’t take it anymore and I can’t continue ignoring the fact that I’ve had a horrible past and it’s the reason why my mental health is so bad. I can’t even make it through the first month of college without wanting to give up because of how hard everything is. And no one even fucking listens they all just have high expectations of you. And not having self esteem or friends or confidence just makes everything worse. Should’ve just offed myself a long time ago cause there’s no recovery from this illness ever. It’s gonna be a long road of misery.,I’ve been depressed since I was 13 and it’s all because of my parents Ever since I was a little kid my parents were always toxic and they haven’t really changed much.

I (19F) am having so much luck in my life!! I am so happy!!!,"Sorry for any mistakes, english isn’t my first language. My (19F) life is going so great at this moment. End 2020 and beginning 2021 were hard on me. I stopped at the university I was going to, mostly because it was draining me emotionally and physically. The time I spend was work or study and it just was all too much for me. End 2020 I got in contact again with an old colleague (21M). And well, since new years eve we’re officially together. We really had the honeymoon phase and we grew out of it, which was a pretty hard time. He went a little too far with a girl friend he hadn’t seen in a while at a party. So it wasn’t really a very hard time, but mostly emotionally draining and I was just tired of everything. But when I knew what kind of study I wanted to try next year, things suddenly got better. I’m going to study to become a math teacher. And in the country where I’m from, there is an enormous shortage of teachers. So I thought, why not send an open application to my old high school. You can always try! And I really wanted a different job, since my school is only one day in the week. Well, I got the job! I am a teacher next schoolyear! And I love it! So I am going to study for something I have passion for, and I will be working as the thing I’ve been dreaming about for years?!?? It is a life goal for me to achieve. My boyfriend and I made up after having a rough time and even had many dates and weekends away to get closer to each other. He is really a great guy and he is trying so hard to help me trust him. He suprises me with flowers time to time, he takes me out on dates, listens to my problems and is ALWAYS understanding of things I don’t feel great about. Our relationship is thriving! But it is even getting better. My boyfriend and I wanted to move out of our parents houses, but we couldn’t find anything and it was no priority. It isn’t really common here to move out when you are 18. My dad has a small rental house in his backyard (the literal translation for it is a “summerhouse” or as we call it a “zomerhuis”). And the girl who lives there, is moving. So me and my boyfriend are going to move in end of this month!!! We are renovating right now. And I just really wanted to share. My life really couldn’t have been any better. Great school, my dream job, my dream man and a house!","I (19F) am having so much luck in my life!! I am so happy!!!

We really had the honeymoon phase and we grew out of it, which was a pretty hard time. He went a little too far with a girl friend he hadn’t seen in a while at a party. So it wasn’t really a very hard time, but mostly emotionally draining and I was just tired of everything. But when I knew what kind of study I wanted to try next year, things suddenly got better. I’m going to study to become a math teacher. And in the country where I’m from, there is an enormous shortage of teachers. So I thought, why not send an open application to my old high school. You can always try! And I really wanted a different job, since my school is only one day in the week. Well, I got the job! I am a teacher next schoolyear! And I love it! So I am going to study for something I have passion for, and I will be working as the thing I’ve been dreaming about for years?!?? It is a life goal for me to achieve. My boyfriend and I made up after having a rough time and even had many dates and weekends away to get closer to each other. He is really a great guy and he is trying so hard to help me trust him. He suprises me with flowers time to time, he takes me out on dates, listens to my problems and is ALWAYS understanding of things I don’t feel great about. Our relationship is thriving! But it is even getting better. My boyfriend and I wanted to move out of our parents houses, but we couldn’t find anything and it was no priority. It isn’t really common here to move out when you are 18. My dad has a small rental house in his backyard (the literal translation for it is a “summerhouse” or as we call it a “zomerhuis”). And the girl who lives there, is moving. So me and my boyfriend are going to move in end of this month!!! We are renovating right now. And I just really wanted to share. My life really couldn’t have been any better. Great school, my dream job, my dream man and a house!",0,,i f am having so much luck in my life i am so happy sorry for any mistakes english isnt my first language my f life is going so great at this moment end and beginning were hard on me i stopped at the university i was going to mostly because it was draining me emotionally and physically the time i spend was work or study and it just was all too much for me end i got in contact again with an old colleague m and well since new years eve were officially together we really had the honeymoon phase and we grew out of it which was a pretty hard time he went a little too far with a girl friend he hadnt seen in a while at a party so it wasnt really a very hard time but mostly emotionally draining and i was just tired of everything but when i knew what kind of study i wanted to try next year things suddenly got better im going to study to become a math teacher and in the country where im from there is an enormous shortage of teachers so i thought why not send an open application to my old high school you can always try and i really wanted a different job since my school is only one day in the week well i got the job i am a teacher next schoolyear and i love it so i am going to study for something i have passion for and i will be working as the thing ive been dreaming about for years it is a life goal for me to achieve my boyfriend and i made up after having a rough time and even had many dates and weekends away to get closer to each other he is really a great guy and he is trying so hard to help me trust him he suprises me with flowers time to time he takes me out on dates listens to my problems and is always understanding of things i dont feel great about our relationship is thriving but it is even getting better my boyfriend and i wanted to move out of our parents houses but we couldnt find anything and it was no priority it isnt really common here to move out when you are my dad has a small rental house in his backyard the literal translation for it is a summerhouse or as we call it a zomerhuis and the girl who lives there is moving so me and my boyfriend are going to move in end of this month we are renovating right now and i just really wanted to share my life really couldnt have been any better great school my dream job my dream man and a house,0.5,"emotional, tired","school, university, study, teacher",none,"lit, tea, bet",2,4,0,3
"Initiated a fun conversation with a stranger, and overcame a fitness fear.","I'm feeling really good as I'm writing this, I am genuinely proud of how I handled myself these past two days - in two separate situations. Trying to get over a bit of a slump, so I forced myself to go on more walks around the city and parks to hit 10,000 steps every day. It's been a really fun atmosphere around the city this weekend because we have the arts festival and pride celebrations both going on in Pittsburgh right now. Yesterday, I saw a cute girl sitting by herself and after reminding myself ""regret is worse than rejection"" I went over and started a conversation with her. The chat was entertaining, easy, light, we learned a bit about each-other and got to have a simple pleasant conversation with hundreds of people walking around the park near us. This was the first time I've approached a girl to talk since my 4 year relationship ended. When she and I had to head our separate ways to get to work after about 30 minutes, I scribbled my number down on a piece of paper and gave it to her. It's been well over a day now and she hasn't contacted me and at this point I'm guessing probably won't but that's OKAY! I'm still incredibly happy that I proved to myself I can still engage in a conversation with a stranger, and have the confidence to go start a chat, and handle myself throughout. Please don't interpret this as a silver lining sort of thing, because it's completely fine if we never talk again, I'm happy about the fact I shut up all those negative worried voices and just walked up to someone and said hi. That's a win for me! Then, this afternoon I was feeling really good after my workout, and had just got my new running shoes in the mail that morning, so I wanted to go for a short run to try them out! I've always been self conscious about my weird abb genetics, mine don't line up nicely across from one another, and I have some light remnants of bacne from when I was a teenager, 25 now. It's 90 degrees full sun in the city right now, so I rode that happiness I was still feeling from the previous day, lathered up in sunscreen and went for my first run ever without my shirt on. I ran along the water and ended up at point park, and then walked home to recover through the arts festival and into the city. While I was walking home some guy in a white truck was yelling ""hey buddy buddy buddy buddy"" out of his window until I turned to look at him, in case I something had fallen out of my pocket or he was needing directions, at which point he shouted ""put a shirt on"" and drove off. I smiled so hard, and I've felt amazing since then. That would have destroyed me like hearing ""chicken legs"" when I was a ball boy for the soccer team at 13, but now It was the best compliment I could have gotten. This jealous turd was so uncomfortable with where he is at physically that he felt the need to get my attention and try to shame me. I felt wonderful, I know I have my flaws, but I also know I look pretty decent, and it was really validating. Again, this isn't something bad where I'm seeing the silver lining, but a genuine sign that I've really grown and can handle that with the knowledge that I look good and I'm doing well! It realllllllly also showed me the truth of that notion that if you've already had a success of some sort early in your day, hardships later sluff off more easily. I knew I already crushed chest and calves that morning, and had a good run, so I could take this on the cheek. All in all it's also been a fantastic example that happiness can compound, and you can use each little nugget to fuel you on to do something else, I'm going to keep going and try to work on getting that every day. Cheers","Initiated a fun conversation with a stranger, and overcame a fitness fear.

College Stress,"Hey! I'll try to make this as simple as possible. I'm a predental student in my first year of college. Currently living at home due to corona.

I should be grateful I even have the privilege to go to school, yet I spend most of my time crying about ""having"" to do it. I told myself I would do better this semester. Up until yesterday I have. I haven't thrown up before any tests like I used to. But I just got out of a midterm that I do not think I did too well on, and the spiral of worst case scenarios starts. A lot of it is due to the pressure of dental school, but a lot is also due to making my dad proud. He's done nothing to pressure me into doing well, but he's given me so much in regards to life and paying for college I feel so guilty if I don't get all As. My problem is mainly my mindset.

I regret not committing suicide when I was younger,"As a teenager I thought about it a lot. Came close once or twice. But I chickened out. Now I regret it so much. If I had done it then, only my family would have been affected. And it’s partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them. Now, I have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if I did it. They don’t deserve it. I wish I had done it when I still had so few attachments, when there was so little harm to be done. Now I am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those I love. Fuck.

And it’s partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them. Now, I have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if I did it. They don’t deserve it. I wish I had done it when I still had so few attachments, when there was so little harm to be done. Now I am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those I love. Fuck.

Stress because of my face,"Sorry for my English) I have a really bad self esteem because I have no confidence around people. I have a port wine stain birthmark on my face and I think I also have repulsive/annoying/serious looking face. Whenever I meet people they always treat me seriously and give me the stare. I feel insecure and awkward to be around people because I always feel self conscious about my face. I have no idea what did I do to deserve those treatments. When I talk to people they see me as an asshole and they treat me like that. They are either cold or serious all the time when talking to me. It pisses me off so much. I am a quiet person and I only talk when people are initiating the talking and most of the time I am silent. I don’t smile often tho, is this why people becomes cold to me? I have no fucking idea. I have little brother and sister and they both have nice friends and their friends treat them normal. Why can’t I be like my siblings? Why do they always treat me like I am a bad bad person when I did nothing wrong? I have this face since I was born and I have no idea how having friends feel like because I had no friends since I was 7 years old, now I am 22. Because of people stares and their treatments, I became a shut in recluse and I didn’t go out because home is the only place where I can feel safe and secure. I also got bullied a lot at grade school all the way to high school. I just want to feel normal. Is this something to much to ask for? Do I really have a bitchy Face?? This is my face photos I lost my hope to live as a normal human being. I am tired living as a recluse loser for more than 15 years (from 1st grade to high school and in college too) Help me please everyone. You can judge my photo and please be honest. Give me your comments and help because I have no fucking idea how can I live like normal person without feeling insecure and being treated like a mean person. TL;DR do I have a bitch face? What should I do? I want friends so bad because I’ve never had one. I am jealous to other people who have friends.

I had a friend over for the first time in two years today,"She literally left five minutes ago, I don't know why but I feel happy, I feel proud of myself. A few weeks ago I was so crippled by social anxiety that I couldn't even bear to try and text anyone but now, I worked up the courage to ask an old friend to hang out and she said yes. She got to my house at 2 pm and left at 9 30 pm, that's like 7 whole hours! I can't believe I did it. I had fun and she said she had fun too. She even hugged me when she left, nobody's hugged me other than my parents in two years. My mom cried because she was proud of me and I feel like crying too. We talked about the usual stuff (school, boys, makeup, memes, etc.) and for one of the first times, I felt like a normal teenage girl doing something that normal teenage girls do. For today, I wasn't the girl that was locked in the psych ward for a while, I wasn't the girl who lost everything when I was 13, I wasn't the freak who never talks at school, I was me. I just acted like myself and it worked? I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness right now, happy that I did it, sad that it's over. Where do I go from here? I have a friend now, that's good right? I feel a little bit proud of myself, is that weird? I just kinda feel good that I did it. I know that this post will get lost in this sub and probably nobody will see it but I just want somebody to know what I did today. I feel at peace. I just got a new fantasy romance book (my favorite kind of book) from the library, I have my comfort plush next to me for support (along with bulbasaur and pikachu plushies i got for christmas grinning_face ) and I feel *peaceful* for once. I think i'm going to read my new book now, I feel like maybe I deserve it. Maybe I really do.. EDIT wow haha, this kinda blew up overnight! Just saw this now as i've been spending almost all of today reading that book, I can't put it down! only a few more chapters left to go lol. I'm not really sure how awards work on reddit, but I know you're supposed to say ""thanks for the gold, kind stranger"" so thanks for the gold, kind stranger! I'll do my best to respond to all of these comments, you guys are the best, and seeing all of your kind words really warms my heart so much <3 POINTLESS EDIT 2 woah, I've cried because of some of your comments! (don't worry, all happy tears) it means a lot. As for the book goes, I loved it and just finished it a few minutes ago, i'm going to the library in a few more minutes to get the second one, it's called ""Caraval"" for those who care. I guess this has a meaning because when I feel especially depressed, I want to get swept away into a fantasy world just like that book does, I really recommend it, it uplifted me (no this isn't an ad for the book i just really love reading)","I had a friend over for the first time in two years today She literally left five minutes ago, I don't know why but I feel happy, I feel proud of myself.

23 F. I feel so behind Everyone. I feel like a 13 year old.,"I know I shouldnt complain at 23 But Ive struggled with depression since I was 13. Every year. For 10 years. I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed. I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend. Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job. Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance. The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done. Its not like Ive tried.

Collecting Pieces of My Shattered Porcelain Soul,"I’ve been meaning to make a personal post for a while. It’s been… a difficult time for me, and I’ve really been struggling lately. Sitting at my terminal typing this out, I’m finding my words and sentences difficult to conceive. Perhaps this is an unsurprising reveal, an antithesis of the otherwise happy mask I don – the mask that says that I’m okay. This is unlike my time earlier this year from my situation with whom we shall call LT, and I would be doing myself a grave injustice if I were to have specified it as such; the root of my current status quo is complex and unending, not simply one-dimensional but a great web of connected, overlapping, and intertwined vertices. No, to contemplate and dwell on the sources of my pain is not why I started writing this post. It’s not why I had, if you’re reading this, decided to publicize it on the internet – expressing myself and delivering my most blatant, clear, and real cry for help was my reason. To be blunt, I’ve lost a lot of motivation and will lately. I’ve lost friends, family, and most importantly, I’ve lost myself. I know that on the surface, anyone would be envious of my life – I’m a well-respected straight-A student who’s involved everywhere both academically and non-academically, with my foot in the door all across the hemisphere and connections all across the globe, with dozens of open job offers and opportunities to ditch my life and move away and make six figures doing what I love and loving what I do, with this and that and so much more and more and more and more. I make people laugh and I make people smile – I make people feel happiness when they haven’t in a while and I stay with them and I help them and I’m there for them because that’s what I do I help people. I look like someone who has everything figured out, and I guess I do have a lot figured out. I’m a star student, a valued and highly-contributing member of everything I’m a part of and I’m amazing at my job and I exceed at everything I do. I guess I have a lot figured out, but I don’t have everything figured out. To say that I’ve lost my friends, family, and myself may be confusing to an outside observer who sees friends and family still loving me and surrounding me and myself still putting on a smile sustained throughout every shared moment, bringing laughter and light and happiness to every room I’m in. Perhaps this is nitpicking the specifics of the English language, but they’re wrong. My friends and family still have me and they haven’t lost me. I said I lost them. I said I lost myself. Anyone who’s ever felt this – and I know there’s a nonzero number of individuals who have, who do – understands what the subtle but important difference is. We understand how it’s possible for ourselves to lose the people we love and the people we care about without them losing us, because it’s not a matter of possession, company, relationship, or otherwise – it’s about identity. There aren’t words for me to describe it. There aren’t words for me to explain it to someone who’s never felt it before. I’ve been writing this for hours already, and words are so, so difficult to come across. I’ve lost everyone and myself. This life that I live, this life riddled with clinical anxiety, depression, PTSD, and a physical disability, is not a life for the faint of heart. I walk through hallways every single day, not fully accepting that I am me. I look into the mirror and see another person. This life is not a life that you want to live, so please do not be envious of it. I’m so utterly stressed. I love all the clubs and organizations I’m a part of and I easily excel at both work and school, but it’s exhausting when I have so much emotional baggage to carry on my shoulders. My PTSD’s never gotten better. My soul is not a golden model – it is one of porcelain, dropped and shattered and crushed into a trillion minuscule pieces scattered by the winds of time. I truly live two worlds one of false happiness and laughter and love, and one of the deserted land in which my consciousness wanders, a barren wasteland devoid of life, myself never truly able to be me, eternally wondering, struggling, and falling. This isn’t something I’ve only recently begun feeling, but something I’ve always felt – only repressed and not allowed to surface for so long. I’m in so much pain, and I don’t want to be in pain anymore. Impale me with a steel hook and savagely tear my heart out. I’ll never function like you; I can’t be normal, I can’t be happy. That’s been me.","Collecting Pieces of My Shattered Porcelain Soul I’ve been meaning to make a personal post for a while. It’s been… a difficult time for me, and I’ve really been struggling lately.

No, to contemplate and dwell on the sources of my pain is not why I started writing this post. It’s not why I had, if you’re reading this, decided to publicize it on the internet – expressing myself and delivering my most blatant, clear, and real cry for help was my reason. To be blunt, I’ve lost a lot of motivation and will lately. I’ve lost friends, family, and most importantly, I’ve lost myself. I know that on the surface, anyone would be envious of my life – I’m a well-respected straight-A student who’s involved everywhere both academically and non-academically, with my foot in the door all across the hemisphere and connections all across the globe, with dozens of open job offers and opportunities to ditch my life and move away and make six figures doing what I love and loving what I do, with this and that and so much more and more and more and more. I make people laugh and I make people smile – I make people feel happiness when they haven’t in a while and I stay with them and I help them and I’m there for them because that’s what I do I help people. I look like someone who has everything figured out, and I guess I do have a lot figured out. I’m a star student, a valued and highly-contributing member of everything I’m a part of and I’m amazing at my job and I exceed at everything I do. I guess I have a lot figured out, but I don’t have everything figured out. To say that I’ve lost my friends, family, and myself may be confusing to an outside observer who sees friends and family still loving me and surrounding me and myself still putting on a smile sustained throughout every shared moment, bringing laughter and light and happiness to every room I’m in. Perhaps this is nitpicking the specifics of the English language, but they’re wrong. My friends and family still have me and they haven’t lost me. I said I lost them. I said I lost myself. Anyone who’s ever felt this – and I know there’s a nonzero number of individuals who have, who do – understands what the subtle but important difference is. We understand how it’s possible for ourselves to lose the people we love and the people we care about without them losing us, because it’s not a matter of possession, company, relationship, or otherwise – it’s about identity. There aren’t words for me to describe it. There aren’t words for me to explain it to someone who’s never felt it before. I’ve been writing this for hours already, and words are so, so difficult to come across. I’ve lost everyone and myself. This life that I live, this life riddled with clinical anxiety, depression, PTSD, and a physical disability, is not a life for the faint of heart. I walk through hallways every single day, not fully accepting that I am me. I look into the mirror and see another person. This life is not a life that you want to live, so please do not be envious of it. I’m so utterly stressed. I love all the clubs and organizations I’m a part of and I easily excel at both work and school, but it’s exhausting when I have so much emotional baggage to carry on my shoulders. My PTSD’s never gotten better. My soul is not a golden model – it is one of porcelain, dropped and shattered and crushed into a trillion minuscule pieces scattered by the winds of time. I truly live two worlds one of false happiness and laughter and love, and one of the deserted land in which my consciousness wanders, a barren wasteland devoid of life, myself never truly able to be me, eternally wondering, struggling, and falling. This isn’t something I’ve only recently begun feeling, but something I’ve always felt – only repressed and not allowed to surface for so long. I’m in so much pain, and I don’t want to be in pain anymore. Impale me with a steel hook and savagely tear my heart out. I’ll never function like you; I can’t be normal, I can’t be happy. That’s been me.",1,,collecting pieces of my shattered porcelain soul ive been meaning to make a personal post for a while its been a difficult time for me and ive really been struggling lately sitting at my terminal typing this out im finding my words and sentences difficult to conceive perhaps this is an unsurprising reveal an antithesis of the otherwise happy mask i don the mask that says that im okay this is unlike my time earlier this year from my situation with whom we shall call lt and i would be doing myself a grave injustice if i were to have specified it as such the root of my current status quo is complex and unending not simply onedimensional but a great web of connected overlapping and intertwined vertices no to contemplate and dwell on the sources of my pain is not why i started writing this post its not why i had if youre reading this decided to publicize it on the internet expressing myself and delivering my most blatant clear and real cry for help was my reason to be blunt ive lost a lot of motivation and will lately ive lost friends family and most importantly ive lost myself i know that on the surface anyone would be envious of my life im a wellrespected straighta student whos involved everywhere both academically and nonacademically with my foot in the door all across the hemisphere and connections all across the globe with dozens of open job offers and opportunities to ditch my life and move away and make six figures doing what i love and loving what i do with this and that and so much more and more and more and more i make people laugh and i make people smile i make people feel happiness when they havent in a while and i stay with them and i help them and im there for them because thats what i do i help people i look like someone who has everything figured out and i guess i do have a lot figured out im a star student a valued and highlycontributing member of everything im a part of and im amazing at my job and i exceed at everything i do i guess i have a lot figured out but i dont have everything figured out to say that ive lost my friends family and myself may be confusing to an outside observer who sees friends and family still loving me and surrounding me and myself still putting on a smile sustained throughout every shared moment bringing laughter and light and happiness to every room im in perhaps this is nitpicking the specifics of the english language but theyre wrong my friends and family still have me and they havent lost me i said i lost them i said i lost myself anyone whos ever felt this and i know theres a nonzero number of individuals who have who do understands what the subtle but important difference is we understand how its possible for ourselves to lose the people we love and the people we care about without them losing us because its not a matter of possession company relationship or otherwise its about identity there arent words for me to describe it there arent words for me to explain it to someone whos never felt it before ive been writing this for hours already and words are so so difficult to come across ive lost everyone and myself this life that i live this life riddled with clinical anxiety depression ptsd and a physical disability is not a life for the faint of heart i walk through hallways every single day not fully accepting that i am me i look into the mirror and see another person this life is not a life that you want to live so please do not be envious of it im so utterly stressed i love all the clubs and organizations im a part of and i easily excel at both work and school but its exhausting when i have so much emotional baggage to carry on my shoulders my ptsds never gotten better my soul is not a golden model it is one of porcelain dropped and shattered and crushed into a trillion minuscule pieces scattered by the winds of time i truly live two worlds one of false happiness and laughter and love and one of the deserted land in which my consciousness wanders a barren wasteland devoid of life myself never truly able to be me eternally wondering struggling and falling this isnt something ive only recently begun feeling but something ive always felt only repressed and not allowed to surface for so long im in so much pain and i dont want to be in pain anymore impale me with a steel hook and savagely tear my heart out ill never function like you i cant be normal i cant be happy thats been me,0.5,"stress, anxiety, depression, emotional","school, student",none,"lit, fam, tea, sus, bet, savage",4,2,0,6

How do I relax and not be stressful when I'm in a state of hopelessness?,"Hey guys im so stressed out right now,this past 2 days I've walking around the house aimlessly I have mild headache and feelingness of vomiting and I feel a lot of blood in my head (like think my blood pressure is raised high) I'm 18 years old and have to talent and skill.

I want to be able to compose and improvise but I guess no one can teach me. I guess it's because i lack creavtivity and I'm not good at applying things . I've always had trouble writing things in school because it turns out dull and unimaginative and I'm just not good at it. I'm always stuck at the basics. And my learning sucks because before I even internalize it I've already read or go through the the material hundreds of times so I know the material if I see it but i cannot apply it. My mother tell me to stop pressuring myself and trying to take in too much but I'm saying that I'm stressed is because I cannot achieve this skill not because it's too much. I want to understand and internalize it and move on execpt for being stucked in the basics and it's boring (This is the way I write so believe me when I say my writing is terrible) What am I suppose to do?

Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues. I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me. I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ) Sigh. Edit I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try. I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading.","Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?

"I'm dying, all alone.","Hello Reddit. I'm a 54 M who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal disease. According to doctors I have a limited time untill cancer spreads everywhere in my body. That, however is not what I want to talk about. I've had a hard life. I spent most of my childhood all alone, with no friends, always desperate for tiniest bit of affection. My parents were both too busy with their jobs to show affection to me. While I'm deeply grateful for all the things they did for me and various ways they shown how much they care about me, back in that time I didn't understand any of that. All I could see was how other parents hug and play with their kids but my parents didn't. I did a huge deal of stupid stuff in my childhood to get their attention. So many stupid and embarrassing things that I don't remember anymore since I really don't want to. Overall I hated my childhood. I've never had any problems with my gender and behaved manly because I was comfortable with it. However since a long time before I stepped into my teen years, I knew I was maybe a little bit different. I hated sports, instead I really loved reading books, there were some other examples but like I said, I don't remember much about my childhood. I also didn't think they were a big deal. When I became a teenager I discovered that unlike any other teenage boys I knew, I was weirdly not interested in girls for some reason. I thought that I'll probably get there in time. I didn't. Now, I was different, in a very conservative and judging society. A society which even divorced people get looked at with anger. When I realized that instead of getting attracted to girls, I like boys, I panicked! I was only 14, I knew very little, I thought I'll get out of this mess as I grow older. In that period of time, I thought I was the only one like that. I was DIFFERENT. for the rest of my teenage life I ignored that, hoping for a change in my preference in the future. When I grew older I became aware of what situation I was in. I was, ... gay. Even to this day I can't say that word without my voice shaking. I tried everything to change, it did not work. Many many questions were raised in my head. Like ""Why am I like this?"", ""How am I going to live like this?"" I encountered a huge moral, religious, and cultural dilemma. It was horrible. Untill this day I've got no answers. It was simply so much for me to process. This quickly affected me and became a major source of depression, anxiety, social insecurities and etc. I gained a lot of weight as a result and went through a very depressing path. Due to all the stress and anxiety I encountered achromotrichia and my hairs started becoming white at early ages. Then I went through a severe phase when I was 18 in which I tried confronting myself. I tried my best to accept who I am. I didn't want to change, just wanted to come clean and admit it. It was not successful. I fell down a hole of worse distancing and anxiety, from 2 of my friends whom I came out to, one refused to believe what I am and one cut ties with me. My best friend, even though he could not believe it, was actually supportive, but soon he moved far away in a different state. I had no one to talk to. My family didn't know what was wrong with me and everything they did to help me only made it worse. I couldn't stand how sad my parents would get if I told them what I was. After all they did for me I couldn't bring tears to my mom's eyes and sadness to my dad. I spent about a month just waking up, eating, and staring at my room with no purpose. I finally had it decided. After 32 days I started planning my suicide. Everything was set on that day. I already did everything and I went to bed early that night so that I'd be ready for the big day. As I was tying the rope around my neck, I heard my little sister's laughter. I burst into tears. Once again I was being selfish. How could I make her little heart sad? How cruel can someone be to hurt a little girl like that? I stopped. I knew this would happen again if I don't make any changes. So I did. I promised my self never to think of that issue again. I suppressed my sexual desires. I kept myself busy with other stuff so that I wouldn't get distracted. I was once again able to wake up without immediately remembering what I was. I could live my pathetic life again. When I was aware of my condition, I made myself a promise. That I wouldn't emotionally hurt anyone and that I don't do anything about my sex life. Fun fact, I'm still a virgin til this day. Despite my family's pressure, I didn't get married. How could I force myself to like a women and ruin her life. Why would I start a family which I can't love the way I should. Why would I ruin someone else's life because of my selfishness. I didn't date or confess to anyone either. As far as I knew, I couldn't live with the emotional weight of accepting who I am. How could I enter a relationship and transfer all my insecurities to another person? The night that I made myself that promise I very well knew this means I will die all alone. With no one to hold me, hug me, or kiss me. Funny how I still crave human contact though I didn't have any even when I was a kid. Rest of my life was boring. I lived. I had a good job with good payment. That's it. I never felt happy. I had some fallbacks but mostly tried eliminating my feelings. I never told anyone what I was again. I lived as the creepy alone man who lives next door. And now I have cancer. With a much more limited time than ever. I'm actually kinda happy, it'll all end soon. I only wish I could be happier, without all these regrets. I would've wished a world in which gay people were not looked at differently but I can't imagine how would that go. I'd also wish for me to be straight but I honestly have no idea how that works. Not once I was interested in women to have a sense of that. I even tried looking at pictures of ""HOT WOMEN"" ( it's hilarious I know. ) for a long time in my young years to see if anything happens but it didn't. So, at the end, I'm soon dying, never kissed the person I loved, or even met the person I loved, full of depression and sadness and 54 years of loneliness. I don't exactly know who will read this, I never got noticed in my life I don't see why I should be noticed now. I also don't know how much time I have left. So I say to the world, farewell, I didn't hate you but I hated myself the most.","I'm dying, all alone. Hello Reddit. I'm a 54 M who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal disease.

So, at the end, I'm soon dying, never kissed the person I loved, or even met the person I loved, full of depression and sadness and 54 years of loneliness. I don't exactly know who will read this, I never got noticed in my life I don't see why I should be noticed now. I also don't know how much time I have left. So I say to the world, farewell, I didn't hate you but I hated myself the most.",1,,im dying all alone hello reddit im a m who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal disease according to doctors i have a limited time untill cancer spreads everywhere in my body that however is not what i want to talk about ive had a hard life i spent most of my childhood all alone with no friends always desperate for tiniest bit of affection my parents were both too busy with their jobs to show affection to me while im deeply grateful for all the things they did for me and various ways they shown how much they care about me back in that time i didnt understand any of that all i could see was how other parents hug and play with their kids but my parents didnt i did a huge deal of stupid stuff in my childhood to get their attention so many stupid and embarrassing things that i dont remember anymore since i really dont want to overall i hated my childhood ive never had any problems with my gender and behaved manly because i was comfortable with it however since a long time before i stepped into my teen years i knew i was maybe a little bit different i hated sports instead i really loved reading books there were some other examples but like i said i dont remember much about my childhood i also didnt think they were a big deal when i became a teenager i discovered that unlike any other teenage boys i knew i was weirdly not interested in girls for some reason i thought that ill probably get there in time i didnt now i was different in a very conservative and judging society a society which even divorced people get looked at with anger when i realized that instead of getting attracted to girls i like boys i panicked i was only i knew very little i thought ill get out of this mess as i grow older in that period of time i thought i was the only one like that i was different for the rest of my teenage life i ignored that hoping for a change in my preference in the future when i grew older i became aware of what situation i was in i was gay even to this day i cant say that word without my voice shaking i tried everything to change it did not work many many questions were raised in my head like why am i like this how am i going to live like this i encountered a huge moral religious and cultural dilemma it was horrible untill this day ive got no answers it was simply so much for me to process this quickly affected me and became a major source of depression anxiety social insecurities and etc i gained a lot of weight as a result and went through a very depressing path due to all the stress and anxiety i encountered achromotrichia and my hairs started becoming white at early ages then i went through a severe phase when i was in which i tried confronting myself i tried my best to accept who i am i didnt want to change just wanted to come clean and admit it it was not successful i fell down a hole of worse distancing and anxiety from of my friends whom i came out to one refused to believe what i am and one cut ties with me my best friend even though he could not believe it was actually supportive but soon he moved far away in a different state i had no one to talk to my family didnt know what was wrong with me and everything they did to help me only made it worse i couldnt stand how sad my parents would get if i told them what i was after all they did for me i couldnt bring tears to my moms eyes and sadness to my dad i spent about a month just waking up eating and staring at my room with no purpose i finally had it decided after days i started planning my suicide everything was set on that day i already did everything and i went to bed early that night so that id be ready for the big day as i was tying the rope around my neck i heard my little sisters laughter i burst into tears once again i was being selfish how could i make her little heart sad how cruel can someone be to hurt a little girl like that i stopped i knew this would happen again if i dont make any changes so i did i promised my self never to think of that issue again i suppressed my sexual desires i kept myself busy with other stuff so that i wouldnt get distracted i was once again able to wake up without immediately remembering what i was i could live my pathetic life again when i was aware of my condition i made myself a promise that i wouldnt emotionally hurt anyone and that i dont do anything about my sex life fun fact im still a virgin til this day despite my familys pressure i didnt get married how could i force myself to like a women and ruin her life why would i start a family which i cant love the way i should why would i ruin someone elses life because of my selfishness i didnt date or confess to anyone either as far as i knew i couldnt live with the emotional weight of accepting who i am how could i enter a relationship and transfer all my insecurities to another person the night that i made myself that promise i very well knew this means i will die all alone with no one to hold me hug me or kiss me funny how i still crave human contact though i didnt have any even when i was a kid rest of my life was boring i lived i had a good job with good payment thats it i never felt happy i had some fallbacks but mostly tried eliminating my feelings i never told anyone what i was again i lived as the creepy alone man who lives next door and now i have cancer with a much more limited time than ever im actually kinda happy itll all end soon i only wish i could be happier without all these regrets i wouldve wished a world in which gay people were not looked at differently but i cant imagine how would that go id also wish for me to be straight but i honestly have no idea how that works not once i was interested in women to have a sense of that i even tried looking at pictures of hot women its hilarious i know for a long time in my young years to see if anything happens but it didnt so at the end im soon dying never kissed the person i loved or even met the person i loved full of depression and sadness and years of loneliness i dont exactly know who will read this i never got noticed in my life i dont see why i should be noticed now i also dont know how much time i have left so i say to the world farewell i didnt hate you but i hated myself the most,0.9,"stress, anxiety, depression, panic, pressure,

I’ve given her so many chances and this was the last one. But all of this is causing me so much stress. I’m constantly anxious. And when I think about having to go back home I start feeling like I’m having a panic attack. My heart beats out of my chest, I get nauseous, I start sweating and my hands start shaking.

How to work without being stressed?,"Hi! I am a college student (F 20) and premed. I am at a competitive college and doing reasonably well academically. My issue is dealing with stress when it comes to workload. When I have too many tasks to do, too many assignments or studying to get done, I feel very overwhelmed and very stressed and upset and sad. I am just 20 and life is easy for me honestly, so I feel very irritated at myself for stressing out to much. When I stress, its difficult for me to work as well, I just want to lay in bed and vanish from the world for the whole day. I just want to be one of those chill, happy, carefree people. The kind of people who can just do all their work but without being so overwhelmed and feeling hopeless. Honestly, I am capable and always get things done and keep a good record. So, why do I always feel so hopeless and behind? I just hate feeling stressed. I know in the back of mind i don't need to stress, and if i didn't, i could just do my work. I am not depressed btw. So, any tips? Thanks a lot","How to work without being stressed? Hi! I am a college student (F 20) and premed. I am at a competitive college and doing reasonably well academically.

UPDATE] I'm (probably) getting back together with my old girlfriend from middle school tomorrow night and I haven't been this happy in years! (Spoiler alert SHE KISSED ME!),"I. AM. OVER. THE. MOON. [Here's the situation, if you didn't see the first post.]( ALRIGHT, so a few nights ago, I invited my old girlfriend from middle school to come over to my place and watch movies. We’ve been hanging out for the last few months, getting to know each-other again, and I’m so, so happy. I’ve been considering seeing if she wanted to start dating again for months, and I finally decided that I was just going to do it and see what happened. I have a friend who I got to do some \~recon\~ for me, and he was 100% sure that she was just waiting for me to make a move, so I wasn’t nervous about her saying no or anything. I was just hesitating because getting into a relationship with someone you really like is nerve-wracking, and also probably because I’ve got some horrible problems with intimacy. Dab. ANYWAY. My roommate was home, so we spent some time playing board games together, which was awesome. But after a bit I texted her like, “Hey, need to hang out with this lady alone for a bit please let me have the living room.” And so she did. And it was just her and me. I made dinner, which was awful because I’m not a great cook and I meant for us to go out to eat somewhere, but we both bike places, so that wasn’t realistic. So we had a meal of very salty stir fry which she somehow managed to eat without complaining one time. While we were eating, we put on a movie. We started the night on opposite sides of the couch, but I (being the subtle and suave woman of the world that I am) got just a little bit closer to her every time I got up to refill my water (which was a lot). Until eventually she called me out and said that I could just sit next to her if I wanted. Which I did. So I did. And I sort of nestled into the crook of her arm, and she put her arm around me, and I rested my head against her shoulder. Gonna be honest, folks, coulda cried. It’s the most *right* I’ve felt in years. Probably the most right I’ve felt in, oh, something like eight years and three months since she moved away the first time. It was like putting on glasses for the first time when you didn’t know how bad your eyesight had gotten. I didn’t realize how much happiness I hadn’t been feeling. Just being close to her like that again was such a rush. But a weirdly calm rush? Like after you’ve been running for a long time and you finally get to flop down in the grass somewhere. I felt so much stress that I’d been holding on for *years* just melt. Gone. And I didn’t even worry about what I was doing or if I was going too fast or if I looked stupid or anything like that. I didn’t worry about her thinking it was weird that my hand was on her stomach. Or if I was being too affectionate. I was able to just stop thinking and enjoy the moment. Feeling her breathing. How soft her shirt was. How *great* it felt to have someone hold me for the first time in ages. And I was so relaxed and so content that the words just slipped out. “We should go out again.” Didn’t fret about how I was going to phrase it or what she would think or how it would affect our friendship. Just said it. And she didn’t say yes. She fucking *kissed me*. She put her hand on my cheek and leaned down and put her lips on my lips and she *kissed me*. I wish I could say it was my first kiss, because the other ones were really regrettable, but it was my first kiss with her. I remember how often I would stress about wanting to kiss her when we were alone together. Drawing comics in my room, or watching TV, or doing homework or whatever, and I never did it. And I *always* regretted not doing it. And now we’ve done it, and it was beautiful and fantastic and I’m gonna scream. I can’t stop thinking about her. I’m smiling all the time. My friends don’t recognize me when I’m not miserable! Every little thing about her just makes me grin like a loon. She called me by the silly pet name that she had for me in middle school. I didn’t know how much I missed that. And she held my hand. She kissed me at the door. AHHH. We get to hold hands in public and I can introduce her to people as my partner and we don’t have to hide that we’re dating anymore because we’re adults and who cares what anyone thinks! I don’t remember the last time I was *giddy* like this! And, of course, I’m also terrified! Because I’ve spent a long time in therapy trying to learn how to be vulnerable with people and silence my brain when it says that my best friends are going to get shipped off to Mexico at any moment, so getting close to people is dangerous. And I’ve been trying to learn how to develop feelings for other people, since I obviously couldn’t have a relationship with her because she was in Yucatan for all I knew. It feels regressive to date her again when I’ve made so much progress trying to get over losing her. And I worry that I’m romanticizing her. I don’t think I am (at least not too badly), but there’s always the voice in the back of my head telling me that I only love this person because she used to be my middle school girlfriend. We’re both totally different people now, and I’m worried that my brain is just settling into this relationship because I want those eight years back with the girl I knew. And I want her parents to like me! I mean, they *do* like me, but I want them to like me as her girlfriend. I want them to approve of me as a partner. Apparently she’s out to her dad, which surprises me a little, but he always seemed like he might be cool. Her mom still doesn’t know. She’s very religious, but my girlfriend (AHHHH) says that she’s trying to get better about LGBT+ stuff since Pope Francis is cool with it, so maybe there’s a chance? Anyway, I’m dying over here. Thank you to everyone who wanted an update on this story! If anybody just wants to hear me gush some more, feel free to reach out via DM’s. My profile is a kinky mess (alt account for lonely nights), so please ignore any NSFW stuff you see. I have so much stuff that I want to talk about and my friends are all tired of hearing about it (although they’re happy that there’s an update and that things are going well), so don't hesitate to reach out!","UPDATE] I'm (probably) getting back together with my old girlfriend from middle school tomorrow night and I haven't been this happy in years!

Chronic stress relief— PLEASE HELP!,"Hi, I am writing this post because I am— to be blunt— very desperate for stress relief. I am only 19, but about half of my life has been spent trying to cope with things that were abnormally stressful (in comparison to my peers). My parents getting divorced in 5th grade quickly turned into my mother being emotionally abusive, my new stepdad making my mom’s house very unsafe, and my mom taking his side and doing very out of pocket things to try to get us to pity her (pretending to be stalked, faking cancer, allegedly being “poisoned,” etc.)… Ever since this began, I had always followed an escapist route, so much so like that I developed a form of psychosis that led me to believe that this world was entirely a dream (and that I had more control over things than I actually do). I have undergone a lot of persona, mental illness related troubles as well, and it truly seems as if there is no situational stress relief. In February of 2020, however, things took a turn for the worse. Due to extenuating circumstances, I was facing an incredible amount of financial stress, and had to scrounge for money to buy dinner. I started experiencing debilitating stomach pain that doctors could not pinpoint. Quarantine followed shortly thereafter, and then I moved 2 hours away from everyone/everything in order to go to college. I had no money and no friends, and my grades began to slip. My stomach pains got worse, and then I also started to experience sleep issues that make it virtually impossible to wake up on time for work, class, etc. unless I have slept 12+ hours. I have seen so many specialists, to no avail, and these health issues simply exacerbate all of the other familial, academic, and financial burdens I am facing. I have been trying to be as patient as I can, but I have now been told that the majority of my health issues are caused by stress itself. This is a catch-22 in many ways, and this news in and of itself is a stressor. Now, I am hyper-aware of my stress, and feel like I can’t do anything without getting chest pains. I am getting a new psychiatrist and therapist, but my appointments are not for a while, but I am not functional until then! I do things to destress daily (art, talking to my family/boyfriend, etc.) but it’s clearly not enough. Any help is appreciated! Thanks! )","Chronic stress relief— PLEASE HELP!

I feel like a soulless robot. And it's ruining my life.,"This is gonna be interesting trust me. I'm 22 years old. And I'm from Sri Lanka. I have some serious problems. And it's affecting my whole life. I don't have or want friends. The only person I consider as a friend outside the family is my girlfriend. Haven't talked to my mother and sister in 2 years (They live in the same house btw). I'm a workaholic and I never skip classes so I always get good grades (Parents never forced it). I just hate being the second. Always want everything to be perfect. Like when I drive my girlfriend somewhere I want the exact time and destination before the trip begins. And I get mad/panicked when there is a change like if she asks me to pull over to get snacks or something. And I always ask her to call the person she is going to meet before and tell me an exact time even though I'm free all day that day. I always map out my tasks. When there is a sudden change I panic and do something stupid. And another funny thing my girlfriend pointed out was that I always check my wallet while shopping even though I know I have more than enough in my pocket. And another thing is that I hate authority. Like in school when a teacher tells me to stop doing something I feel like he/she is taking away my creativity and freedom. Another thing is that I plan everything way too much. I have mapped out my whole career while still in college. I even have specific tasks I want to do in my 30s and 40s and I have done everything according to that plan so far. And I get really depressed when something fails. After that, I hate everyone and won't be happy again until I accomplish something good again. I just can't shake off that loss. Am I batshit crazy???? I don't consider myself arrogant but sometimes I think why do I need all this stress? I'm just a kid. But other times I feel like I'm some kind of a chosen one and I need to do everything better than others. This behaviour is starting to become a problem. And the people I love like my mother, sister and my girlfriend are getting hurt because of me. I really want to know what I can do to change this. Any help would be appreciated. I just want to be happy. Thank you in advance.","I feel like a soulless robot. And it's ruining my life. This is gonna be interesting trust me. I'm 22 years old. And I'm from Sri Lanka.

Haven't talked to my mother and sister in 2 years (They live in the same house btw). I'm a workaholic and I never skip classes so I always get good grades (Parents never forced it). I just hate being the second. Always want everything to be perfect. Like when I drive my girlfriend somewhere I want the exact time and destination before the trip begins. And I get mad/panicked when there is a change like if she asks me to pull over to get snacks or something. And I always ask her to call the person she is going to meet before and tell me an exact time even though I'm free all day that day. I always map out my tasks. When there is a sudden change I panic and do something stupid. And another funny thing my girlfriend pointed out was that I always check my wallet while shopping even though I know I have more than enough in my pocket. And another thing is that I hate authority. Like in school when a teacher tells me to stop doing something I feel like he/she is taking away my creativity and freedom. Another thing is that I plan everything way too much. I have mapped out my whole career while still in college. I even have specific tasks I want to do in my 30s and 40s and I have done everything according to that plan so far. And I get really depressed when something fails. After that, I hate everyone and won't be happy again until I accomplish something good again. I just can't shake off that loss. Am I batshit crazy???? I don't consider myself arrogant but sometimes I think why do I need all this stress? I'm just a kid. But other times I feel like I'm some kind of a chosen one and I need to do everything better than others. This behaviour is starting to become a problem. And the people I love like my mother, sister and my girlfriend are getting hurt because of me. I really want to know what I can do to change this. Any help would be appreciated. I just want to be happy.

For some reason, the admins decided to not give a spring break this semester (so we have no breaks), and cut the semester shorter by a week.

School Stress,"Hello everyone! I’m currently in my last year of high school and I’m having a hard time dealing with it. I live in Eastern Europe and in my country we have those big exams at the end of high school that are supposed to evaluate all the knowledge you’ve gained since grade 1. Two exams are mandatory - one in literature and the other one, you can choose the subject yourself. For my second one I chose physics and I’m pretty confident with that. However, literature has always been a huge burden on mine and I find it extremely difficult to prepare for that exam. I am beyond angered constantly that I have to deal with that subject - I do understand that literature increases your knowledge about the world and teaches you how to support your arguments, but the emphasis that is given on that exam by my teacher and parents is too big and I can’t do anything but hate the guts out of it. Now, me being the perfect student, raised by perfectionist parents, I can’t even think about having low grades on that exam. I study in a “highly respected” school, where teachers can be pure evil to you. I also have to prepare for my university entrance exams and work on a project of mine, which stress me out even more. At the end of the day, I feel so drained out and like I’ve achieved nothing, even though I have spent the whole day in school and preparing for exams. I’ve started feeling physically unwell. I used to work out a lot but now I don’t have the energy to go out of my bed. My blood pressure is very low and I’ve gained weight. I’ve given up to emotional eating one too many times. I wanna shine for prom. I want to look my best at the end of the school year and feel my best when real life hits me. But I’m scared that school will drain me out too much. This is more of a rant post because I know the only way to fix the situation is by resting more. I just can’t let myself rest. My mind is constantly busy with my work. Anyways, any help or advice or simple encouragement would be appreciated. If you made it that far, thank you for taking the time to read about my problems. ","School Stress Hello everyone!

My life is a mess and I don’t think it’d be worth the time to clean it up,"I’m new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far. I apologize for the lengthy post. My depression started late in my sixth grade year. It began with subtle thoughts of self harm and lengthy sessions of negative thinking. By the end of the school year my family moved to the out skirts of a small town bordering the state of Washington. Once we settled in my mother forced me to ride out the last few weeks of school. My first day at the new school felt unwelcoming. Most people generally ignored me and the few that didn’t were very manipulative, using the fact that I was new to bolster their reputation. By the time that summer vacation rolled around my only friend invited me to stay at his house for the majority of the break. Most of the things that plagued my mind faded into obscurity only coming back during long nights. Nearing the end of my stay my friend decided to show me his grandfather’s stash of firearms with the supervision of his grandfather. Later that night I had developed a plan to use one of the guns to end it all but never came to fruition due to leaving the next day. The rest of the summer flew by, leading into the next school year. I was still relatively new to the school so I was still in the same circumstances I was last year. A new element that was introduced was a lack of interest and work ethic which lead to my grades plummeting. Late November I was met with extreme fatigue that would last throughout the day resulting in me sleeping through the majority of my classes, this would continue to the next school year. I still hadn’t made any friends, only interacting with others when I had to. During lunch breaks I usually sat alone, sometimes being bothered by groups of the popular kids to get me to say something to satisfy their curiosity and boredom or a concerned teacher or staff member. The end of the year my grades hung around failing and barely passing resulting in me going to summer school. This summer was uneventful besides summer school. My friend didn’t make any attempts to reach out to talk to me so I just laid around stewing in my thoughts in the isolation of my room. 8th grade was like 7th grade only differing slightly. My period of isolation during the summer had left stricken with disturbing thoughts, paranoia, and anxiety. During group activities I struggled with speaking to others, finding myself stammering when trying to speak at a normal rate and spoke quietly. I became embarrassed and would intentionally push myself away from projects. Later in the year one of the annoying kids became excessively irritating and decided to wake me as I slept during science class. I broke my silence and started to berate him. This left a lasting impression with some of my classmates. After that day I started to focus on my anger. As time went on our fights became long winded and increasingly aggressive. Not long after, I got physical with him after he had confronted me outside of class. He said something that I took offense to so I grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him against the lockers. After that event he gradually stopped speaking around me and skipped the last day once he had heard that I was going to fight him. The summer was the same as last year. Summer school was as helpful as ever and my only friend not making any attempts to speak with me. I again left to my thoughts of constant anger and depression. My freshman year began slightly different. I had developed a friendship with a girl that rode the bus with me. She was also dealing with depression due to her abusive and controlling mother. My depression dramatically increased in late November when I developed a crush on a girl from my neighborhood. I became self destructive, insulting my appearance and intelligence. I came home in a bad mood all the time either in a blinding rage or in tears. I convinced myself that I wasn’t good enough for her and that nobody cared about me, that I was worthless. A week before Christmas break I had come up with a new plan to kill myself. The last week before Christmas break was unbearable. The thought of suicide weighed heavily on my mind. Thoughts constantly screaming at me throughout the day. The last day before break during first period I broke down in tears. I went to my councilor and confessed that I was going to kill myself after Christmas Day. I was then taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with depression. I the spent about a week and a half in the hospital and was released early due to good behavior, some acting, good attendance to activities, and the fact that Christmas was coming. I left being prescribed Zoloft and felt relatively normal for once in a long while. Christmas break came to an end not long after and school felt very much different. In mid to late January I began getting migraines from taking Zoloft and was shortly changed to fluoxetine. Not long after I then started to prepare for Valentine’s Day. A couple of days before Valentine’s Day my friend and I went to get some flowers for my crush. I had made plans with my crush to meet up but she missed it and rearranged for the 17th. We met up that night and I confessed my feelings to her to the best of my ability. She told me that she didn’t feel the same way and friend zoned me, we haven’t spoken since. I broke down in tears later that night, spiraling back down into my depression. I would find out sometime later that she never had any feelings for me and was already in a relationship before my confession. Covid would soon come around to cut the school year short and brought a new wave of anxiety and fear on top of my failed attempt at a relationship. Around mid May I stopped taking my medication thinking that I didn’t need it any longer. June through August made a great amount of progress on myself. I began the next school year happier than the last and put effort into my work. This would last until November. I quickly fell back into my old habits, constantly degrading myself. In late November I found out how my sisters truly felt about me. They felt nothing but hate for me, doing nothing but insult my appearance and intelligence and the fact that had no friends to their knowledge. In December my fights with my sister got worse and now my mother started to side with my sisters and said that I’ve changed for the worst, that I wasn’t her son, wishing for the “old me” to come back. She than grounded me and took all of my possessions. She would threaten me with the hospital and would threaten to call the cops if I didn’t comply. This would continue throughout January and end in early February. After that happened I began looking for friends so i had someone to relate to. By March I had found a couple of people that gave me purpose to live again. They helped me find a job and gave me someone to talk to when a felt like nothing. In April I started working and hanging out with my friends more often. By May it all fell apart. I had gotten angry at work from being overwhelmed and two of my friends were working with me that day. They thought that I was satan himself and started to spread rumors about me. As a result I lost all of my friends and almost lost my job. Since then I’ve kept my job but have started to inflict pain upon myself from cuts to burns. I’ve apologized to everyone since but I still hate myself for everything. I’ve felt worse ever since then and have been struggling with my battle against depression once again. I hope that I can get some advice or at least get some comfort so I can try to get back on track","My life is a mess and I don’t think it’d be worth the time to clean it up I’m new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far.

I the spent about a week and a half in the hospital and was released early due to good behavior, some acting, good attendance to activities, and the fact that Christmas was coming. I left being prescribed Zoloft and felt relatively normal for once in a long while. Christmas break came to an end not long after and school felt very much different. In mid to late January I began getting migraines from taking Zoloft and was shortly changed to fluoxetine. Not long after I then started to prepare for Valentine’s Day. A couple of days before Valentine’s Day my friend and I went to get some flowers for my crush. I had made plans with my crush to meet up but she missed it and rearranged for the 17th. We met up that night and I confessed my feelings to her to the best of my ability. She told me that she didn’t feel the same way and friend zoned me, we haven’t spoken since. I broke down in tears later that night, spiraling back down into my depression. I would find out sometime later that she never had any feelings for me and was already in a relationship before my confession. Covid would soon come around to cut the school year short and brought a new wave of anxiety and fear on top of my failed attempt at a relationship. Around mid May I stopped taking my medication thinking that I didn’t need it any longer. June through August made a great amount of progress on myself. I began the next school year happier than the last and put effort into my work. This would last until November. I quickly fell back into my old habits, constantly degrading myself. In late November I found out how my sisters truly felt about me. They felt nothing but hate for me, doing nothing but insult my appearance and intelligence and the fact that had no friends to their knowledge. In December my fights with my sister got worse and now my mother started to side with my sisters and said that I’ve changed for the worst, that I wasn’t her son, wishing for the “old me” to come back. She than grounded me and took all of my possessions. She would threaten me with the hospital and would threaten to call the cops if I didn’t comply. This would continue throughout January and end in early February. After that happened I began looking for friends so i had someone to relate to. By March I had found a couple of people that gave me purpose to live again. They helped me find a job and gave me someone to talk to when a felt like nothing. In April I started working and hanging out with my friends more often. By May it all fell apart. I had gotten angry at work from being overwhelmed and two of my friends were working with me that day. They thought that I was satan himself and started to spread rumors about me. As a result I lost all of my friends and almost lost my job. Since then I’ve kept my job but have started to inflict pain upon myself from cuts to burns. I’ve apologized to everyone since but I still hate myself for everything. I’ve felt worse ever since then and have been struggling with my battle against depression once again. I hope that I can get some advice or at least get some comfort so I can try to get back on track",1,,my life is a mess and i dont think itd be worth the time to clean it up im new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far i apologize for the lengthy post my depression started late in my sixth grade year it began with subtle thoughts of self harm and lengthy sessions of negative thinking by the end of the school year my family moved to the out skirts of a small town bordering the state of washington once we settled in my mother forced me to ride out the last few weeks of school my first day at the new school felt unwelcoming most people generally ignored me and the few that didnt were very manipulative using the fact that i was new to bolster their reputation by the time that summer vacation rolled around my only friend invited me to stay at his house for the majority of the break most of the things that plagued my mind faded into obscurity only coming back during long nights nearing the end of my stay my friend decided to show me his grandfathers stash of firearms with the supervision of his grandfather later that night i had developed a plan to use one of the guns to end it all but never came to fruition due to leaving the next day the rest of the summer flew by leading into the next school year i was still relatively new to the school so i was still in the same circumstances i was last year a new element that was introduced was a lack of interest and work ethic which lead to my grades plummeting late november i was met with extreme fatigue that would last throughout the day resulting in me sleeping through the majority of my classes this would continue to the next school year i still hadnt made any friends only interacting with others when i had to during lunch breaks i usually sat alone sometimes being bothered by groups of the popular kids to get me to say something to satisfy their curiosity and boredom or a concerned teacher or staff member the end of the year my grades hung around failing and barely passing resulting in me going to summer school this summer was uneventful besides summer school my friend didnt make any attempts to reach out to talk to me so i just laid around stewing in my thoughts in the isolation of my room th grade was like th grade only differing slightly my period of isolation during the summer had left stricken with disturbing thoughts paranoia and anxiety during group activities i struggled with speaking to others finding myself stammering when trying to speak at a normal rate and spoke quietly i became embarrassed and would intentionally push myself away from projects later in the year one of the annoying kids became excessively irritating and decided to wake me as i slept during science class i broke my silence and started to berate him this left a lasting impression with some of my classmates after that day i started to focus on my anger as time went on our fights became long winded and increasingly aggressive not long after i got physical with him after he had confronted me outside of class he said something that i took offense to so i grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him against the lockers after that event he gradually stopped speaking around me and skipped the last day once he had heard that i was going to fight him the summer was the same as last year summer school was as helpful as ever and my only friend not making any attempts to speak with me i again left to my thoughts of constant anger and depression my freshman year began slightly different i had developed a friendship with a girl that rode the bus with me she was also dealing with depression due to her abusive and controlling mother my depression dramatically increased in late november when i developed a crush on a girl from my neighborhood i became self destructive insulting my appearance and intelligence i came home in a bad mood all the time either in a blinding rage or in tears i convinced myself that i wasnt good enough for her and that nobody cared about me that i was worthless a week before christmas break i had come up with a new plan to kill myself the last week before christmas break was unbearable the thought of suicide weighed heavily on my mind thoughts constantly screaming at me throughout the day the last day before break during first period i broke down in tears i went to my councilor and confessed that i was going to kill myself after christmas day i was then taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with depression i the spent about a week and a half in the hospital and was released early due to good behavior some acting good attendance to

What should I do about chronic stress,"Hi, I'm 20 years old and kind of accepting that I've got chronic stress issues. I'm not sure how to deal with it exactly, and it's been 3 months. I remember seeing a doctor a while ago and talked about what caused my stress/breakdown last semester and he said it was acute stress. I didn't really know what that meant at the time, but overall I felt like it was an unhelpful experience because all of his advice (exercise, things like that) and wisdom didn't really help me or I knew would not work because I had already tried. I even tried antidepressants because I thought it could have been something I needed, but that did not help. I'd say for the past 2 years of my life I've done a great job at handling acute stress. That was the only type of stress I knew. Chronic stress, however, is something that I don't understand. It's new to me, and requires a greater amount of life changes and mental perspective. It feels inhuman almost to have chronic stress. It is admittedly frustrating because I feel too young for it; I'm at an age where I should continue to develop myself with my hobbies and stuff. But instead every day is typically a rollercoaster. My ability to concentrate/focus has been incredibly diminished, and I find the idea of getting back in to school stressful. I am an engineering major, but if math stresses me out I'm just not sure if I can keep it in my life. On the flip side, I want to be doing those things because I liked the challenge. The stress is like a token that just keeps flipping and makes things confusing. I doubly worry because I start to think I have mental health issues, and the fact is that stress CAN open up mental health issues. I find that when the stress gets to a breaking point, which has only happened once in my life, I shut down and withdraw and make what changes feel necessary instead of opening up in to some sort of mania or whatever but fuck man how am I supposed to know what to expect if it keeps going. There are things which cause me stress that I don't think are supposed to cause me that much stress, but they simply do because it's chronic I guess. I don't know if I""m supposed to push on and work on my problems in ""the storm"" or withdraw and bide my time. I also seem to suffer from anhedonia, an inability to feel pleasure. If I isolate myself from anything stressful (school, work, etc.) it is possible to feel some pleasure, albeit a small amount. I've been trying to tackle the problem by getting back in to the things that used to give me pleasure (weightlifting was a big one) and then taking on the more stressful things (school and work), but the stressful things seem to outdo any pleasure effects. What really kills me is that my sleep suffers; if I could get 8 hours a night, I would be able to push through without worrying, but for the past 3 nights I've gotten probably 5-6 hours of sleep. I haven't even started school yet, and I don't really work THAT much. So now I'm sitting here typing this post and worrying about stress again. I truthfully don't know what to do, or what in particular causes my chronic stress. I want to live life like normally so I can combat depression and things like that, but then the stress keeps me up. I am seeing a counselor, and hopefully a therapist soon, but I am in the early stages of that. Is this something that can be medicated? Can you ""medicate"" stress away? Or does it boil down to lifestyle changes? I've done a pretty damn good job of having a healthy lifestyle for the past couple years, which is another frustrating thing. I don't drink, smoke, but admittedly I think about sex too much and I'd say that is my vice at the moment. It was also a source of stress for me that contributed to this chronic stress in some way. That said, I don't pursue sex in an unhealthy way but I might be a little more flirty or resort to jackin it to try and fill some sort of void that I'm missing. I eat pretty healthily, not a fan of soda or junk food, I see food more as calories and less for pleasure. Other than that, I loved weightlifting and for a good while was able to do both cardio and heavy lifting. Now, however, I feel like that contributes to my stress a little bit because I know I don't sleep enough to be able to lift weights and recover without it causing too much stress. I want to bulk up a bit, and get back to more intense/heavier lifting, but I'm not sure if that's even healthy for me in my given state. At the same time, I get stressed out after a week or two if I'm NOT doing that. Lol again with the flipping a token thing. I don't really like being around my friends or people as much when I'm like this, not because I am in a ""bad mood"" but because I know I can't simply vibe with them. I'll be too worried about feeling stressed out to actually enjoy it. This is why I think I really like counseling because it's just a place for you to go to talk about your problems with someone. My only solace has been learning how to play my guitar, but that's not what I intend to do with the rest of my life, and it doesn't always take the stress away. Sometimes I just get tired of playing it. What are my options? I'm 20 years old, live at home with my dad, so I don't have much responsibility thankfully. I've done quite a bit with my life that I'm happy about, so I feel like I was doing what I wanted, so it's tough thinking about how to change. All the things I've been doing have helped me grow as a person and alleviate that sort of depression you get when you're just not doing anything with yourself. But again now when I start doing those things I experience a lot of stress and have to come to a stop, thus depression can come back... I kind of yearn for when things didn't feel this stressful; the first two years of college feel like they could have been ages ago, and man I thought THAT was a challenge because during that time I was just finding myself. Looking back on it though it was just easy to live in the present and deal with stress as it came, not battling it every waking hour. I understand things about mindfulness, meditation, making the right choices, etc., but man that doesn't explain why I can't get enough sleep.","What should I do about chronic stress Hi, I'm 20 years old and kind of accepting that I've got chronic stress issues.

Job making my depression worse,"hi everyone, this is my first post so plz be gentle with me ) I have pretty bad anxiety and depression, and I can't seem to keep a job for more than a couple of weeks because of it. recently I started working again since the pandemic, and it was going well at one job until I got a better offer somewhere else. However, now that job is giving me more anxiety and depression than I think it's worth. it is kind of my dream job until I finish college, but it's full time, while I'm also in school full time as well and they don't have any part-time options for me. I've only been there for about a week, but every single shift I find myself completely dissociated and unable to focus on anything. Then when I get home it takes several hours to calm down and be able to do any of my school work, let alone regular life things. I feel shitty for wanting to quit, but I don't really know what else to do / any advice?","Job making my depression worse hi everyone, this is my first post so plz be gentle with me ) I have pretty bad anxiety and depression, and I can't seem to keep a job for more than a couple of weeks because of it. recently I started working again since the pandemic, and it was going well at one job until I got a better offer somewhere else.

I am a 17 year old student in korea and I am stressed overwhelmingly by academics and the SAT. Please read my story and tell my story to others. I am going to jump next week. Goodbye.,"I just finished writing my final goodbye letters to my mom, dad, and brother. Goodbye. I want to talk to someone but I don’t know who. I’m planning on overdosing on lean or some other drug. I know that my parents will just say that depression and suicidal thoughts are just common and focus on my grade and GPA. I feel hopeless. I want to know where to take my life from. No comfort or support will help me much. I feel like I’m better off gone than having to work more and study and prepare for school and the SAT. To me that is all there is to life. I’m sorry mom and dad. Even though I spent time with you I simply can’t get over it. Goodbye and I love you because this is not your fault. Thank you for all the memories and support you have me for the past seventeen years of my life. The times when you scolded me that if I didn’t get a good SAT score, then I would be sent to academies and my dog would be sent back to its previous home. These days believe it or not, I’ve been doing some things that a regular high schooler should not do like sipping lean, vaping, and taking sleeping pills to sleep at night from the nightmares. I hope I can overcome this, but that time seems to late. Goodbye.","I am a 17 year old student in korea and I am stressed overwhelmingly by academics and the SAT.

I've gotten to a point where I'm just tired of it all. I'm tired of the constant stress of having to worry about what time either one gets home, so I can tune the awful noise with my headphones; cranked up to near full volume. I love both of them and always will, but its to the point where I just don't feel like its worth the money of staying with them for 2 more years while I attend my local Community College in order to save money.

I don't want to see anyone and talk to anyone. My mother said that it's been too much time since I actually made a real smile, not a fake one.

Another thing that doesn't help is that I haven't seen my long distance partner in almost a year. Since this school year started I've been under non stop stress. In November I felt like I was extremely close to a big breakdown and potentionally a burnout, but I somehow managed to dodge that bullet. Since that I've been trying to fake it until I make it, except it's getting really hard now to pretend that everything is OK. Last semester I barely passed my exams (which disappointed me, I always aim to get good results and I get disappointed and feel guilty when I don't). The last exams of this year are coming up, next to that I have 5 other deadlines and an internship to finish, all in 2 weeks time. Every morning I wake up in sheer panic trying to remember what day it is to get myself mentally prepared for deadline stress, study stress, work stress or performance stress. Sometimes a combination of two, three or all of them. I don't even know if this was the right place to post it, but I had to let it out somewhere. I don't feel comfortable opening up to my parents and my partner doesn't seem to understand me very much when it comes to these type of things. If anyone has experienced something similar, or has an idea of something I could try that could potentially help me get through the upcoming 2 weeks of hell, I'd love to hear it. Thanks for even taking a few minutes out of your day to read my venting post, it's very much appreciated.","Advice needed, I just broke down because of stress Pretty much the title.

School fucked me up,"Just wanna find a vent I’ve always been the all A’s student at my school and everyone has so much expectations on me. I’ve always have this cheerful bubbly personality on the outside, but I’ve never been actually happy about my current life. I feel so stressed and i kept crying constantly because of academic pressure and my teacher’s expectation. It has gotten to the point where I can’t take care of myself and I even took a day off from school because of that recently. (Happened about 2 weeks ago) I’ve picked myself up but ever since that incident I will cry for no reason and have a mental breakdown over really small things. My motivation has been decreasing rapidly and I’ll constantly isolate myself from interacting with anyone. I just got scolded by my mom and I’m now all by myself, crying alone. My concentration has also become worse the older I got, I used to be able to read a book in one sitting, now I can’t even finish a single page of homework. I’ve been struggling so hard to get my work done but I can’t. I had to stay up really late every night (2am - 4am) only to get my work done. But I have to wake up 7am in the morning everyday for school. It’s honestly torturing and I literally wanna die. Aside from mental health issues, it causes my body to react negatively, I stopped having my period whenever school starts and I will gain fat really rapidly. The more fat I gain, the more insecure I get, I don’t even wanna go out because of my fat body. I tried to tell my friends, they are really supportive, but whenever my depressive feelings strike, I just don’t have the motivation to speak to them, I wanna keep them out from my negative feelings, the same goes to my family. School and academic stress has fucked me up entirely but I cannot stop it. I cannot quit school or I will lose my seemingly “bright” future, but I don’t know how long I can do this anymore. TLDR school gave me too much pressure for being the top student, fucked up my mental and physical health. I cannot do this anymore.","School fucked me up Just wanna find a vent I’ve always been the all A’s student at my school and everyone has so much expectations on me.

"If someone could help me out after having read my rent I would he grateful, and if not that's fine as well.","Hello people, My life feels at this moment worthless, I wouldn't mind someone taking it away, (at least having said that , that's out of the way). School started again, in my final year now I turned 18, the beginning of the end of school. But because of complications (mental health) I had to redo a year a while ago. All my friends have left now, and I feel very stuck and alone everywhere, in school, with my family, I'm not the person I was during my vacation, I've changed again to the back old stressed and scared me. And I hate it. It's hard because I just don't want any people around me, yet I also feel the need for someone. But I can't bring up the motivation or will power to do so, and I'm in this constant state of not really being there. I don't see any way how to build up a friendship with someone I see at school for example. While I definitely need such a thing. Everyone seems so not on the same level, and I think well that's not gonna work out. Besides that minor stuff stresses me, I'm no longer mindful in any way. I feel so god damn hopeless, and so scared for the future, so immense scared, that I'll fuck up. I can't even go to bed, simply because every part in my brain wants to stay awake, no matter how tired I am, I try to stay awake, until I can't no more, because I've no motivation to fall asleep and start the day over again. I really don't know what to do at this point. I'm still on a waiting list for therapy, and as it seems it will for sure take another month if I'm lucky (most likely 3 months). Everything in me just surches for escapes, it's sleep deprivation, or I grab alcohol, while I pledged to not drink. I can be way more impulsive than normally. It's weird. All this combined with moments of de-realization. I don't know what is going on with me the last week's, but I'll not be able to continue in this way. I feel a stranger in my own body, in this world, with everyone... Could someone please explain me why this all happens. And what could help, or yeah, I don't really know.

i don’t feel like i’m suicidal “enough” to warrant help but at the same time...,"..every time i *do* feel suicidal it hits me like a ton of fucking bricks. like right now. my heart is telling me to go jump off the fire escape. the scene keeps replaying in my head while i lie in bed motionless and numb. i feel like a fake depressed person because i avoid my responsibilities and just play video games or do anything meaningless to fill time. it just makes me feel like a lazy person and i often think i’m just using my depression as an excuse to feel lazy and that i deserve the suicidal thoughts. i want to admit myself to inpatient but again, i feel like i’d just be taking up space as a fake depressed person. even though sometimes i really can’t stop thinking or fantasizing about killing myself. i just don’t want to experience the stress of school anymore. i lost all my friends. i’m also scared of leaving my partner to fend for themselves. and i don’t know if my school would even permit a leave of absence anyways. also covid, of course. every time i think about or try to do homework, my brain goes into suicide mode. even though i love learning and what i learn about. i’m so far behind in my classes. because maybe i’m just lazy and not actually depressed. i don’t know it’s not like anyone will see this i just need to talk about it. i feel so nauseous. small edit i went to sleep last night and am only now checking reddit after class and i.. i’m so blown away by the supportive responses and the support offers i’ve gotten. when i said i thought no one would see this i genuinely meant it and so to be able to read everyone’s comments, even the ones of people who are in the same spot, it has given me more hope. i feel so warm and fuzzy inside. i felt i had lost all my friends to my depression and i haven’t felt this feeling in my chest in a while, and i can’t overstate how flattered i am, i would cry if i could. i’m gonna try to reply to people. you all really helped me last night and today. i woke up and it’s a bright, sunny day. i can hear the cars and the people outside. i’m still sad and unstable but i feel hope in my chest. so thank you. really. white_heart ","i

kinda?) finally getting the thai teenager experience.,"ummm so I'm not sure what to put in the title because it's kinda complicated but I guess what I said works. just a warning that this gonna be a long post also lol. lately i've been making so many new friends. local friends!! i didn't have a lot of local friends previously (people from my country) as i has to cut off people from my old school, and now i am not inside my country's education system either. most of my friends are overseas, my bestfriends are almost 13,000 miles away. i've always wanted to have people i could go hangout with. people with the same timezone to hangout with. people to talk about shit going on here, not ones that i am just explaining the whole situation to, but one that shares an experience. i've first met this friend through a facebook group. i had a post that went viral and he added me. he then commissioned my art. i then found out we're the same age and like a lot of things in common. i was really happy to have a new local friend. he also let me send him happy mail and i made him a rick roll card!! then i joined his discord server and got to meet his classmates. his friends are really nice to me so we soon became friends too. i send them happy mail. i help them cheat on their online exams and their english homework. we have now talked about maybe hanging out at the amusement park when covid gets better. my friend says that i'm like the unofficial 46th student of their class because of how much I interact with everyone. i feel so accepted. its so nice. then i met my friend's other friend. it was actually just a day ago. we hung out and talked on call and it was so fun!! i asked if i could send him mail too and he was really enthusiastic. and told me i can send as much as i want and he will keep a collection. then this new friend introduced me to his gf and shes likes stationery!! she was so excited when i told her i do snail mail. she said she had never done it before and would love to write with me. i was really scared that i would somehow not be able to hangout with these people because of what happened in the past. but now im literally doing nothing but being myself and i am making so many friends!!! i just feel so fucking happy rn. i am making so many new friends. i will get to use thai language more. i could probably even HANGOUT with them in MY COUNTRY now!!! they actually all live in a different province from me, so it's not like i can see them all the time, but it's not super difficult to meet them either. IM SO EXCITED. I FEEL LIKE I AM FINALLY GETTING THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE A LIFE OF A TEENAGER IN THAILAND. I thought I wouldn't have a chance as I'm about to not be a teenage very soon. I have voice calls and video calls to be in all day. Like I've always dreamed of. People are enthusiastic at what I do and I don't have to only care about what they like. It makes me feel so fucking full inside I'm bursting with joy. I know this post was quite long and I maybe didn't even make that much sense but thank you so much for listening to me!! Also, if anyone wants to know what happened about my old friends I can tell you. But only via a letter lol.

Im Overwhelmed,"I think I have too many things going on... maybe idk. Im struggling to manage it all. Im a 3rd year engineering student, but I am only in 4 courses at the moment, the courses are interesting and I enjoy them, but I really struggle to be motivated to study. I used to care, now I expect to fail despite being perfectly capable of achieving high grades and wanting those grades. I live with my bf, who is currently immigrating into Canada via spousal sponsorship, enter a mound of paperwork that is proving to be really challenging. Its stressful because I have to be on him to get it done. He wants to immigrate but is held back by his own insecurities. Things only seem to move forward when I blow up at him (which Ive done recently so he is doing his bit now). Problem is my bit of the paperwork is now overwhelming me because when you have moved 21 times and worked 8 jobs the questions ""where have you lived in the past 5 years"" and "" state your employment history for the last 5 years"" become extremely tedious. I have a job lined up for when I finish this semester in May, I'm excited for it, but they havent told me where I will be (anywhere in Canada) or what I will be doing yet. So thats a lingering worry. I also need to find another job to start in September. I need to buy a car, my job has a 99% chance of requiring one, my parents will pay for it (yes I know I am incredibly lucky and priviledged and Im really thankful to them for being so generous), thing is I have no clue how to buy a car. They are willing to spend up to 10k on it (aiming for the 6-8k range), and I am terrified to drop so much money on a something that I am so inexperienced in purchasing. Also I have a month and a bit to buy it. My brother will be living with me and my bf next year (starting Sept 2020), I need to show him the ropes on how to adult, Im really excites but also scared because I tend to become ""Mom 2"" in these scenarios and that is really not what he needs. Also the process of accelerating his schooling and getting him into uni (he is 16 compressing high school into 1 year) is heavily reliant on my knowledge of both high school and university and my ability to contact people here at the uni. This is not even mentioning his course load which I have decided I just can't help him with because I have too much going on. I'm trying to balance my life, I want to spend time with my bf, brother and friends, but also not completely flop my classes. I want to do fun things, but am scared to. Thing is Im so unproductive, when I study Im slow, I get 1 hour of work done in an entire day no matter what I try. Everyone says to exercise, but thats just another thing on the todo list that never gets done. Also I will not be converted to any kind of mindfullness, Im done with all types of religions. Im so overwhelmed and frustrated. Oh and my taxes are due and i have no clue how to do them. TL;DR I am a young adult that is new to basic things like buying a car and doing taxes, I am overwhelmed by the amount of variables and choices around me and frustrated because I cant seem to be productive.","Im Overwhelmed I think I have too many things going on... maybe idk.

I'm a masochist,"I am at the edge. I won't commit suicide but the depression has pretty much taken over my life. My depression is not me. It is a disease. This disease has manifested itself into me discarding self-care. I don't want to buy new clothes for myself, engage in any enjoyable hobbies, or do anything that I would enjoy. I keep putting those things off. Every day for the past... two years, I have been putting off self-care because I'm ""not there yet."" It's this perpetual feeling of inadequacy, of constantly trying to catch up. I think school partially did this to me. I was conditioned into prioritizing work first and foremost. It instilled into me a kind of selflessness. Leisure was relegated to 20 or so minutes of recess/lunch, it wasn't important. This isn't an angsty ""school sucks"" sentiment. I mean it does, but my viewpoint doesn't come from a place of complete directionless anger. I don't want to blame anything for my problems. But the cold truth is that school rewards masochism, which I in part adopted. I tried to escape the stress by procrastinating, which would lead me to missing deadlines which resulted in self-hatred. I had to escape the stress, along with myself. It's funny because I wasn't even that good of a student. What was the point in studying when I'm was and am so unhappy? I am a masochist. I put off happiness because I feel as if I do not deserve it. It makes me feel inhuman. Who would do such a thing? I haven't felt happiness in literal years. Even during moments of leisure I never felt content. I always had to be ""doing something"" because productivity is an instilled and admirable trait. I feel warped. I don't feel human. I let everything pass me by. I'm so fucked up. I won't commit suicide. I can't. But right now, the thoughts are taking full force. I'm so disgusted with myself. That I don't even behave like a normal person. That I'm so compulsive and masochistic and crazy. I have nothing. I am lonely. I am selfless. I just want it all to end. I want to wake up as a normal person. I feel dysphoria with myself as a person. Not gender dysphoria, but the term in a general sense. An unease and deep dissatisfaction with myself. Even when I should be feeling happy, I'm not. Everything just feels so fake and shallow. How can someone like me ever heal if their brain has been wired like this for so long? This chemical imbalance is only getting worse.","I'm a masochist I am at the edge. I won't commit suicide but the depression has pretty much taken over my life. My depression is not me.

I got accused of plagiarism at university for a maths assignment?,"Last week I received an email about plagiarism on my last maths assignment. It was an online subject that required students to check in online and view the tutors online whiteboard, each student is signed in with their student number. That at first caused me to have an anxiety attack at work but later on got over it because I came to my senses that this was causing me unnecessary stress when I did not plagiarise. The email required me to have an interview with three people, tutor, unit coordinator and an observer (but I am not obliged to go, but I did anyways). The email notified me to bring the person I plagiarised off from.. but the thing is I actually don't know anyone let a lone plagiarised off someone? I did call them up and said I did have a friend to GUIDE me with my maths assignment who does not do the subject at all, basically does a different course completely, same uni but different campus. So fast forward to the date of the interview I was pretty confident of clearing my innocent, I brought my friend in and they asked the guy next to be was the other plagiariser while exposing their name? I blurted out who's that by accident. So during the interview they brought out my assignment and the other persons, only one question consisting ABC were exactly the same!!! HOW UNCANNY?? The thing is, that was only like 10% of the assignment. I do understand their point of view, out of a few hundred students me and this person had the exact same answers. So some of the answers were wrong but the plagiarised section they were asking me how I got the working out for these questions, my dumbass really did guess it but I was able to explain how I got it, the coordinators face was literally like this dumb bitch got an easy question wrong AND plagiarised it. But my explanation that literally disregarded it and just said HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO PLAGIARISE? I did say I got them off the lecture notes but I really have no idea how I have the same answers as the other person. Anyways, during the interview, they were trying to throw my friend and I under the bus to admit to at least cheating, which we did not. All assessment at uni requires a signature to agreeing that all works is done by yourself only. They were trying to imply I was cheating because my friend with me looked over my assessment questions. They were trying to get him to agree basically that he did my assignment questions, thank god he kept saying I only GUIDED her with example questions just like the assignment you have given him (which he actually did only guided me because I am trash at maths). (They said if you did get a tutor for this assignment, that is cheating and that is a misconduct as it is not your own work). But seriously what the hell, I actually don't know anyone in this subject because it is all online (lol I barely attended the online lectures, it is summer break after all). After the interview they're just telling me to think about who I plagiarised off from, so this is just implying I'm already screwed because I have to see the dean if he will dismiss this matter. There are two guidelines I have to follow which is regardless brutal, if I did plagiarise (record, fines, etc) and if I did not. If I did not I'm still not off the hook. Basically this is stressing me out badly for no reason, I can't prove my innocence. When I walked outside the room, I think the person who I apparently plagiarised was there, I have never seen them before in my life. I'm just causing shitty outcome scenarios in my head like, what if the person said I did but I didn't? They school just wants to hear the answer they wanna hear??? I can't prove my innocence, how can they prove my plagiarism? The unit coordinator is the one who reported this but said he can't clear it, the dean has to?????? I just have to wait for a dreading email what to do and more interview(s). I have two final exams left for summer and I just can't clear my head for this unnecessary problem (one of the the exams is this subject).

They were trying to get him to agree basically that he did my assignment questions, thank god he kept saying I only GUIDED her with example questions just like the assignment you have given him (which he actually did only guided me because I am trash at maths). (They said if you did get a tutor for this assignment, that is cheating and that is a misconduct as it is not your own work). But seriously what the hell, I actually don't know anyone in this subject because it is all online (lol I barely attended the online lectures, it is summer break after all). After the interview they're just telling me to think about who I plagiarised off from, so this is just implying I'm already screwed because I have to see the dean if he will dismiss this matter. There are two guidelines I have to follow which is regardless brutal, if I did plagiarise (record, fines, etc) and if I did not. If I did not I'm still not off the hook. Basically this is stressing me out badly for no reason, I can't prove my innocence. When I walked outside the room, I think the person who I apparently plagiarised was there, I have never seen them before in my life. I'm just causing shitty outcome scenarios in my head like, what if the person said I did but I didn't? They school just wants to hear the answer they wanna hear??? I can't prove my innocence, how can they prove my plagiarism? The unit coordinator is the one who reported this but said he can't clear it, the dean has to?????? I just have to wait for a dreading email what to do and more interview(s). I have two final exams left for summer and I just can't clear my head for this unnecessary problem (one of the the exams is this subject). I NEED TO STUDY.",1,,i got accused of plagiarism at university for a maths assignment last week i received an email about plagiarism on my last maths assignment it was an online subject that required students to check in online and view the tutors online whiteboard each student is signed in with their student number that at first caused me to have an anxiety attack at work but later on got over it because i came to my senses that this was causing me unnecessary stress when i did not plagiarise the email required me to have an interview with three people tutor unit coordinator and an observer but i am not obliged to go but i did anyways the email notified me to bring the person i plagiarised off from but the thing is i actually dont know anyone let a lone plagiarised off someone i did call them up and said i did have a friend to guide me with my maths assignment who does not do the subject at all basically does a different course completely same uni but different campus so fast forward to the date of the interview i was pretty confident of clearing my innocent i brought my friend in and they asked the guy next to be was the other plagiariser while exposing their name i blurted out whos that by accident so during the interview they brought out my assignment and the other persons only one question consisting abc were exactly the same how uncanny the thing is that was only like of the assignment i do understand their point of view out of a few hundred students me and this person had the exact same answers so some of the answers were wrong but the plagiarised section they were asking me how i got the working out for these questions my dumbass really did guess it but i was able to explain how i got it the coordinators face was literally like this dumb bitch got an easy question wrong and plagiarised it but my explanation that literally disregarded it and just said how did you manage to plagiarise i did say i got them off the lecture notes but i really have no idea how i have the same answers as the other person anyways during the interview they were trying to throw my friend and i under the bus to admit to at least cheating which we did not all assessment at uni requires a signature to agreeing that all works is done by yourself only they were trying to imply i was cheating because my friend with me looked over my assessment questions they were trying to get him to agree basically that he did my assignment questions thank god he kept saying i only guided her with example questions just like the assignment you have given him which he actually did only guided me because i am trash at maths they said if you did get a tutor for this assignment that is cheating and that is a misconduct as it is not your own work but seriously what the hell i actually dont know anyone in this subject because it is all online lol i barely attended the online lectures it is summer break after all after the interview theyre just telling me to think about who i plagiarised off from so this is just implying im already screwed because i have to see the dean if he will dismiss this matter there are two guidelines i have to follow which is regardless brutal if i did plagiarise record fines etc and if i did not if i did not im still not off the hook basically this is stressing me out badly for no reason i cant prove my innocence when i walked outside the room i think the person who i apparently plagiarised was there i have never seen them before in my life im just causing shitty outcome scenarios in my head like what if the person said i did but i didnt they school just wants to hear the answer they wanna hear i cant prove my innocence how can they prove my plagiarism the unit coordinator is the one who reported this but said he cant clear it the dean has to i just have to wait for a dreading email what to do and more interviews i have two final exams left for summer and i just cant clear my head for this unnecessary problem one of the the exams is this subject i need to study,0.5,"stress, anxiety","school, university, exam, study, assignment, student",none,lit,2,6,0,1
Feeling stressed like never before,"I’m in college and I have a light load of classes, especially considering loads other students have. It’s insanely difficult for me to keep up while working 35 hours a week, but I have no choice. I need the money. This week I finally got myself out of a depressive episode enough to get work done since I had some extra time off work this week. I was doing good. But I got into a car accident early in the week and I’ve just been so insanely fucked up mentally ever since and stressed about the financials of fixing my car that I have missed several major assignments in a class I was already super behind in. It’s math, a subject I struggle in enough as it is, and I just can’t seem to catch up. I requested less hours at work so I’m only going to be working 20-25 hours a week but my professor just gives so much homework and shrugs me, specifically, off. I don’t want to fail this class. I turn everything in late even if I know it’s taking a good chunk of my grade off but fuck. I’m exhausted and can’t sleep, I have no appetite (I have eaten maybe one proper meal in the last 4 days), and I just feel like I’m at my breaking point and literally nobody understands. Everyone just says “haha me too college sucks zany_face ” but I’m at a point I wish I just don’t wake up in the morning. I don’t know what else to do. I feel like I’m drowning.","Feeling stressed like never before I’m in college and I have a light load of classes, especially considering loads other students have.

"2 years since I dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression, I finally signed back up for classes yesterday.","I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without. I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

UNIVERSITIES REALLY DON'T CARE,"i am sure covid has been extra stressful for everyone, countless people have lost their jobs, their health has deteriorated and I'm sure students can relate that online classes have been extremely stressful. I do also understand where the professors stand, they had to shift their whole life to sitting in front of a computer to teach to a bunch of unenthusiastic students who won't even turn their cameras on, but, at the same time, we too are overpaying for an educational experience that isn't an experience at all. Sitting at our computers all day, rushing to finish deadlines and studying for tests and just staying focused is hard, while managing work that's just the cherry on top. I do have some professors who have been very understanding and have helped a lot, curving grades, providing extra credit, then we have my stats professor. He bases our grades so heavily on the tests (2 tests and 1 final), I have no idea what grade i have but I know i'm failing along with the rest of my class. I've never done this badly in school ever! I have never failed a class to say the least. Not understanding to our circumstances, as an international student, having to be awake at 3am to focus of math is a feat. I've emailed him expressing my concerns, no reply. And its not just me, the entire class is failing. I have enrolled in the same class with a different professor for next semester in case I do not make it, which I won't unless he curves it a whole 10%. The amount of stress that is just waiting to blow up is insane and I cannot do anything to help! My thoughts keep circulating back and fixating on that one thing.

NEED HELP FOR A STRESSED OUT UNI STUDENT,hey guys I'm new here so sorry if I'm ranting crying_face . This is my 2 semester of uni and honestly I'm dying. I was suppose to leave my country for uni since its abroad but it's been online for now. Just a background I've dealt with anxiety and depression for some years now and even used to take medication for it. I'm off of it now. Uni sucked for me even in semster 1 but somehow I got through. This time everything just feels so much harder and like I'm definitely failing most of my courses. I've never has a good relationship with academics. A lot of my problems stem from that. And honestly at this point I'm searching Google 'how to study' because I have no idea. I'm not too sure if I absolutely hate my degree. Its bachelor of economics. It's just even if I dont like that it's not like I have something else in mind that I would want to study. I already failed a course in sem 1 and taking it again in sem 2. And now I feel I'll fail like 4 of my courses for sure. Half of the stuff I dont get and I dont know how do I study especially when all I feel is so much street and anxiety and pressure. The more I think about it the more I get panic attacks. And just not doing uni is not an option for me. Like I've definitely thought of it but know its something I cant do. So now I'm here just asking for help. I dont know what to do. I cant seem to study and even if I do I cant seem to get things. Being online I feel such a discontent from professor and my peers alike. Like I genuinely have no uni friends. I cant fail because I dont have time to do those failed courses again. Most of my assignments up till now have either been bad grades or just not submitted. I dont know how I'm suppose to do the rest of the term. Honestly feel like just not doing life.,NEED HELP FOR A STRESSED OUT UNI STUDENT hey guys I'm new here so sorry if I'm ranting crying_face .

Desperate call for help,"I(21F) am from a religious and a conservative family. I am the golden girl in my extended family and in my own home too. I have great and the bestest of cousins. The problem is I am depressed. Like really really depressed. I don't know when it started but I can date it back to 2014 when my brother died and i actually felt it properly as before that I was going through a rough patch with my mother. As for my mother she is a great woman, very respected, and religious. My father is a great man too, he built himslef up from zero to where he is now. They both love eachother but are also in a very toxic relationship where they hurt eachother. Fom my point of view a lot is expected from me. I changed my nature to be the bubbly one and the comedian of the house after my brothers death although i am an introvert, I started hiding my suffering when i saw my mom suffering due to my brother's loss. I became toatlly differen5 person and my friends even commented on that. I brought the laughters back in house not realizing that i was slowly losing myself. I indulged in emotional eating and started gaining weight but no one was kind, not even my own mother. I also was suffering with the worst acne. So, I developed anxiety which worsened in 2019 where i would start shaking whenever i had to meet someone new or talk to someone on phone. People indirectly , even my own aunts, started commenting on my weight and how i look older than my age. I was 70 kg (155 lbs) (I am 5'4""). I started indulging in not so good practices and developed an eating disorder. I fasted for 2 whole months with just an egg salad without yolk, which was about 260 calories, at the end of the day and even that i purged. I then started eating only soup at night and even vomited that.. all the time i was working out for 4-5 hours a day with my umiversity. I eveb water fasted for 8 days which was broken because my dad was worried and brought pizza for me to eat. Eventually, I did lose weight. I became obsessesd, I knew something was wrong so i started working on myself as when i gathered the courage my dad didn't beleive in eating disorder and told me to hust start eating properly and mom just consoled me and to eat healthy. There were instances where i would wake up at night and gobble rice fron the fidge or two packs of pop corn at 2am in dark while tears poured down my face. I hated myself by tpeople loved the new me. They loved how i looked. And I couldn't help but think that i did the right thing. But i stil stopped as i love my teeth and purging was said to affect them. I then developed stomach ulcer and was put on hunger medication and was said to eat something every 2-3 hours. I did, but i also gained weight. And now again people have started berating me. I am right now preparing for the biggest test for my life. I have always dreamt of it. I know my depression has just kept getting worse. I can feel it. I never thought of killing myself as , as a muslim we are taught suicide is very wrong. But for some time now i have started fantasizing of someone killing me, getting hit by a car, developing a terminal illness and what not. I lost my grandmother earlier this year, i loved her and was myslef her favourite but i just couldn't cry. Why? I don't know. I know i loved her. I did. Recently my mother have started abusing me emotionally.  Every tactic if manipulation and gaslighting she could use to make me feel less, she did. The sad thing is she isn't even realising it. She just seems to think that i am in the wrong. Although, my father clearly told me not to be worried about my weight and just to focus on studies and after exams he'll join the gym with me if needed. He has also said to my mom to help out by being understanding while i am preparing. But she doesn't and i don't want to create another problen between them. Also i have been a mediator vetween both of them in all their fights. I am my mithers therapist. But now I am just fed up. I don't wanna listen to anyone. I just wanna run away. I am so so depressed that i have lost my motivation and don't even know what to do. Please help me out someone. Note I am sorry if some things don't make sense. Please bear with me . I am so overwhelmed with my thoughts and feelings all over the place.","Desperate call for help I(21F) am from a religious and a conservative family.

I don’t know how to be a college student,"I’m a first generation college student (First-born in US, first in family to go to college) pursuing an engineering degree who has no idea what the hell is going on. I messed up a lot last semester and ended with a below-average GPA, and this semester things are slightly better but I’m still nowhere near where I should be. I’m studying and going to classes from the morning until 1 or 2 AM every day, and I’m still not doing as well as all my friends. I’m constantly sad and stressed out and I don’t know what to do.

Just a bunch of first world problems,"I’m a freshman in college. I was one of those people who did well in high school without really trying. I knew it would be harder coming into college but a great first semester pulled me into a false sense of security. I’m currently sitting on a 3.1 (seriously, why are B’s so fucking detrimental?). This would be fine(ish), since I’m a comm major and nobody in my field of work (especially in my city) gives a shit about your academics in college. You can either do the job or you can’t. Problem is, my scholarships and aid are riding on my grades. I can’t afford to go to college without them. I never learnt proper studying or time management skills so I’m trying desperately to catch up, but I’m being buried under classes, orgs, and general life responsibilities. I stupidly thought that managing 12 hrs with only one class that has tests and no orgs meant I could do 15 hrs with three classes that test. Haha nope. I joined four orgs and paid the dues for all of them. Two of them I never attend because I don’t have time, so that’s $80 down the toilet. One of them wants too much time and the other is confusing and point opportunities are hard to come by. For the past two weeks the meetings that normally go until 8 30 have been running up on 10 30 instead. I’m trying to take care of things that would actually help me, like doctor and psych appointments. Doing this means I’m missing classes, meaning my grades suffer. I’m not seeing a therapist anymore because I don’t have time. There are so many things I have to do, fees I have to pay, papers I have to fill, etc. and I can’t do them all. My family says exercise and eat well. In what time? How do I stick to my calories when I’m constantly binging from stress? I’m getting back to my old weight and I hate it. I can’t stand the idea of anyone seeing me naked, so a love life (as if I’d have time for it) is out of the question. I’ll spend all day working and then realize I accomplished almost nothing because I was agonizing over a single task. But I need to be a perfectionist with these things because they are such a huge part of my grade. None of the things I do are interesting to me. I’m in an English and theatre course and I either hate them or can’t give them the dedication I want, despite the fact that I love those subjects. After every test I make a plan to study better but it quickly gets thrown to the wayside as other shit is piled onto my plate. So now I’m cramming and stressing. My room is a disaster. My side is always dirty because I’m too overwhelmed to pick it up. My roommate is a super light sleeper so I have to go to bed before I can finish my stuff just so she can get her sleep. And it’s not her fault, but I just want to yell “I’m sorry you can’t sleep, but I have shit to do. Let me fix my shitty GPA while you enjoy your 3.9, thanks.” This isn’t the half of it, but what I can get down before I have to get back to work. I’m sure some of these things have easy solutions but I’m too blinded by my stress, sadness, frustration, everything. I welcome any advice anyone may have. These problems are stupid and unimportant in the grand scheme of things, but I can’t ignore them. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and just see me and how I feel.","Just a bunch of first world problems I’m a freshman in college.

I have school tomorrow and I’m so fucking tired,"I know this sounds like some edgy fake shitmix some fourteen year old has conjured up for the sake of attention but I’m just so tired. I’ve struggled with my mental health for the past year and a half now. My thighs always have some sort of fresh cuts on them, I feel like lead and I can’t seem to hold onto the small rays of happiness even if I wanted to. And school is just….so intimidating. I told everyone I’d get up and make lunches for my sister and I, because since cooking is something I like I thought taking that initiative would help me get up in the mornings. But now the aspect of everything going wrong and being too swamped with work makes my head heart and I feel like my hearts about to burst because even this small thing that could’ve been a reprieve from the cold dark and unmotivated pit I was in will just slip from my fingers like everything else. I don’t know how to be a teenager who’s dealing with mental health and being around people who have no idea what it actually is like. I know I sound like I’m putting on some kind of noble, “woe is me” kind of attitude by saying this because I’m so “edgy” and “quirky” and for what? For wanting to rip my guts out? For saving money for my funeral? For not being able to wash myself or keep up basic hygiene because it takes so much fucking effort? And I’m so tired of hearing the adults who’ve had nothing but success call suicidal people the scum of the earth, or my father and mother, (if I have to call them that) screaming at me for yet another flaw I didn’t notice existed until they pointed it out. Or the emo dipshits","I have school tomorrow and I’m so fucking tired I know this sounds like some edgy fake shitmix some fourteen year old has conjured up for the sake of attention but I’m just so tired.

Does anyone else start sobbing when they think of how much they missed out on because of their depression?,"I feel like my depression took my entire teen years from me. I spent all my free time in high school crying and self harming at home while everyone else had friends and hobbies and went to parties. Then I did the same thing in college. I didn’t even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn’t control. Now I’m 21 and just graduated college and I’m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I’m just so broken right now. Can anyone relate to this crippling regret of missing out on what were supposed to be the best years of your life?","Does anyone else start sobbing when they think of how much they missed out on because of their depression?

I’m kinda disgusted with myself,"I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained. I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did. I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try. Edit wow I did not expect to get such a huge response. I basically passed out on my bed right after posting this but I only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment. Also a big thanks for the awards. It’s been a difficult path, I’ve been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like I haven’t made so much as a dent in the mess but I appreciate the kind words and motivation. I’ll be reading through the comments and try to respond to as many as I possibly can","I’m kinda disgusted with myself I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting.

I don’t want to make this longer than it needs to be so my basic question is, how does everyone deal with family expectations?

They think I’ve finished when I really haven’t, because I got tired of them wondering why, of feeling like a failure for now being where I should. But now keeping up the lie has made things worse. Now I’m expected to be progressing and getting a new job etc when I’m still where I have been for the last 5 years. It’s been 6 months and I’ve already been accused of having too much time on my hands despite studying full time and working 3 jobs. Because they don’t know. How do you get yourself out of a hole that you dug yourself? And how do you do it when you’re terrified of the consequences of telling the truth. Maybe I’m a coward but I feel lost.

"Identity Crisis, Easily Influenced, More concerned about others.","Hi. I never thought I would get to this point but I’ve been having an identity crisis for what feels like only 2+ months but these things don’t happen overnight. I used to be consumed by my goals, my grind (growing up it was mostly me and my small circle) but now that I’ve accomplished these things I have fallen into the worst depression of my life (because these goals weren’t rooted in myself, just there to prove a point). I find myself more concerned with my friends lives, comparing myself to what they’re doing, and checking my phone to ensure I’m in constant communication with someone but not actually living my own life. I’m wildly indecisive and influenced (for example switched from an in person class to an online class because of fear of a professor and conversations I had with someone, forgetting that I only wanted to be in school if it was in person.

Idk what to do.","Identity Crisis, Easily Influenced, More concerned about others. Hi. I never thought I would get to this point but I’ve been having an identity crisis for what feels like only 2+ months but these things don’t happen overnight. I used to be consumed by my goals, my grind (growing up it was mostly me and my small circle) but now that I’ve accomplished these things I have fallen into the worst depression of my life (because these goals weren’t rooted in myself, just there to prove a point). I find myself more concerned with my friends lives, comparing myself to what they’re doing, and checking my phone to ensure I’m in constant communication with someone but not actually living my own life. I’m wildly indecisive and influenced (for example switched from an in person class to an online class because of fear of a professor and conversations I had with someone, forgetting that I only wanted to be in school if it was in person. I use social media as a way to self harm, watching others live the lives I want to (I know more about what my ex and their friend group is doing then how to solve my problems).

Had a really tough exam and to make the cherry on top a guy on a bike stole my phone.,"Hi guys, First time posting and would really appreciate it if any of you guys have any tips for calming down. Traditionally, I used to get sad as a teenager over things but as I got old it just became anger. Which I handled okay because I use to go running. Then my facial hair started falling out and all of a sudden I am feeling a lot more sad than angry. I just feel like the world is put to get me and things aren't going right for me. I feel like someone put a curse on me. Things were going well and now everything is just going awful. Thanks for reading. xo","Had a really tough exam and to make the cherry on top a guy on a bike stole my phone.

I don't wanna do this anymore.,"I'm not a big reddit poster but what I have to say.. I'd like at least a select people to hear it. Idk if I can help anybody but if it helps you to know people are going through the same thing, I'll tell you I'm going through it. I'm a 26 yo male, and used to be the happiest man, without a problem in the world. It all started when I was about 16/17 years old. I had chronic pain and severe kidney problems. I went to multiple doctors searching for a cure or a procedure that would return me to normal. None of the doctors I visited seemed very interested in fixing my issue as they did in just prescribing me narcotics. I was pretty straight laced and at first wasn't even interested at all in taking these medications. I just wanted my problems fixed. However, the doctors insisted and quite literally talked me into taking these medications that controlled me with script after script coming for the better part or 4 years. Here I sit now, after 8 surgeries and probably close to 100 prescriptions for oxycodone, Vicodin, Dilaudid, and yes, even fentanyl. Wishing I would have just dealt with the pain and never given in to taking the narcotics even once. Addiction is such a real thing and it can happen to anyone. I hate to say I'm not at fault for this because I'm sure some of the blame is on me. But this cycle of addiction, depression, and suicidal thoughts and actions would likely not be there if it wasn't for me being given script after script and forcefed pills since I was a teenager. Now I buy drugs from the streets just to feel anything and I just wish more than anything that one day I can put this neverending cycle behind me. I'm sorry for the rant guys and thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this. For reference, this was in the US during probably 2012-2017 when so many doctors were getting in trouble with the law for over prescribing opioid medications. We hear all over the news about what happens to these doctors and pharmacists... But what about the likely hundreds of thousands of lives that were impacted by them getting patients hooked on pain killers, forcing them to either go through constant depression, pain, and withdrawal symptoms (which sometimes feel worse than death itself), or going out and finding these drugs elsewhere and buying them for their own use. This is what led to such a major opiate epidemic in the states, and why so many have lost their lives to this painful and seemingly impossible to escape cycle. Again, sorry for the rant. I love you guys red_heart ","I don't wanna do this anymore. I'm not a big reddit poster but what I have to say.. I'd like at least a select people to hear it.

I need some stress help,"So I've never posted on reddit or go much to anyone for this kind of stuff. I'm a young female marine, I tend to take care of myself, but recently I've got some things that just kinda..gnaw at me. Here's my stressors. -I am on on crutches currently due to multiple stress fractures in my foot. -My mother has some severe medical problems, her favorite dog is dying right now. She's very emotional and lives with my dad, who's a criminal at heart, he's a felon and gets in jail about twice a year. He's also very emotionally abusive -Im dealing with a very difficult MOS school, the atrittion rate is about half of the class fails every time. I won't be specific, but chemical warfare is hard. I may get recycled due to injury. -Ever since I got on crutches, the platoon avoids me like a plague. I can't ever call or ask anyone for help. Marines are tight knit, we're like a family, but I don't think I could depend on any of these people. Just this weekend not a single person would lend me a laptop to finish a course online so I wouldn't get dropped, but on my phone I could see all those same people on steam when they told me they were busy doing it too. I've gotten a lot of nasty comments about my crutches, people tend to use it to put me down. -im worries about my physical fitness if I'm gonna be out of commission so long. We have PFTs, CFTs and weight requirements to adhere to. I try to do upper body, and some other excercises, but doc tells me to take it easy, I feel like I can't. There's a couple other childhood things I won't mention, but these are the meat and potatoes of what's going on. If anyone has any advice, please voice it. I'm just tired of going to my fellow Marines and being told to stop worrying about it.","I need some stress help So I've never posted on reddit or go much to anyone for this kind of stuff.

I feel like I have no friends,"There’s a long backstory to part of my feelings around this topic, but the basics are that I have a twin and we’ve always shared everything, including friends; nearing the end of high school they got really annoyed with this and told me all our friends weren’t mine because they were friends with them first so I essentially cut off a good five or ten people. Then I had my one friend who was mine and only mine. She got a boyfriend near the end of high school as well though. We were still close, but I rarely saw her. Then they broke up two years ago, and we’ve been super close for the past two years. Until recently. She got a new boyfriend and I hardly see her or talk to her anymore. My sister who I’ve always been close with has a long term boyfriend too, and I’m considered the third wheel to their relationship so I don’t hang out with them much either. One of my friends from high school who I cut off recently got back in touch with me and we’ve been getting close again. But about a month ago she got a new boyfriend and I haven’t talked to her since. Another of my friends just moved a 20 hour drive away for school. Another one just moved to a new continent for a study abroad program for a year. I thought my mental health was getting better.

I feel like I’m getting dumber and dumber everyday.,"I don’t know if there’s something physically wrong with me or if it’s just stress related, but for about 2 years now, I feel as if my cognitive abilities have been worsening. I can barely hold a conversation anymore. When I do talk, I stutter/stammer/mispronounce words. My mind blanks out a lot and my attention span is nonexistent. I used to be a really smart kid. Performed very well on the SAT despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school. Then after high school, I became a full blown hypochondriac along with having generalized/social anxiety as well. 2 years ago I felt like I was THE man, and today I feel like an incompetent moron who becomes less functional each day. I think I’m recovering from my anxiety disorders, but I sometimes wonder if I’m actually just normalizing them, causing the illusion of recovery. I don’t know where to go. I’ve really been trying to get better but I feel like I go two steps forward and three steps back. Can anyone else relate to this? Currently typing this out standing in the shower, feeling pretty down right now. EDIT ironically enough, I forgot to mention that my memory is complete shit now. My long term memory isn’t bad but holy shit, I’ll forget what you said in a conversation 10 seconds after it’s said.","I feel like I’m getting dumber and dumber everyday.
