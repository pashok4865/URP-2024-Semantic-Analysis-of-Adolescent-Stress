# URP-2024-Semantic-Analysis-of-Adolescent-Stress

This study explores the application of LSTM models to iden-
tify primary causes of negative stress for adolescents (ages 10-19) across
social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter. Today, most adoles-
cents around the world suffer from significant amounts of stress and poor
mental health due to a variety of causes. By identifying these stressors,
intervention techniques can be developed and implemented, in order to
reduce stress levels and improve the overall mental health of adolescents.
