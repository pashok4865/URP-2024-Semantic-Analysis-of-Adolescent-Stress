school stress hello everyone im currently in my last year of high school and im having a hard time dealing with it i live in eastern europe and in my country we have those big exams at the end of high school that are supposed to evaluate all the knowledge youve gained since grade two exams are mandatory one in literature and the other one you can choose the subject yourself for my second one i chose physics and im pretty confident with that however literature has always been a huge burden on mine and i find it extremely difficult to prepare for that exam i am beyond angered constantly that i have to deal with that subject i do understand that literature increases your knowledge about the world and teaches you how to support your arguments but the emphasis that is given on that exam by my teacher and parents is too big and i cant do anything but hate the guts out of it now me being the perfect student raised by perfectionist parents i cant even think about having low grades on that exam i study in a highly respected school where teachers can be pure evil to you i also have to prepare for my university entrance exams and work on a project of mine which stress me out even more at the end of the day i feel so drained out and like ive achieved nothing even though i have spent the whole day in school and preparing for exams ive started feeling physically unwell i used to work out a lot but now i dont have the energy to go out of my bed my blood pressure is very low and ive gained weight ive given up to emotional eating one too many times i wanna shine for prom i want to look my best at the end of the school year and feel my best when real life hits me but im scared that school will drain me out too much this is more of a rant post because i know the only way to fix the situation is by resting more i just cant let myself rest my mind is constantly busy with my work anyways any help or advice or simple encouragement would be appreciated if you made it that far thank you for taking the time to read about my problems,2,0.4199977,0.20708612,0.3729162,0.4199977

parentified parent with severe depression im a male and at this point id be glad if someone or something would take my life it all went rapidly downhill after i got my first child who is a wonderful little boy now so similarly vital and full of life and energy like i was when i was little everybody used to go jesus christ the energy on that boy i mean everybody now i feel dead for a long time and next to the current situation i feel even worse i was physically parentified by my father fulfilling his beliefs and standards and taking care of his needs when he was terminally ill with leukemia for years he held me responsible for him and as a buffer between my brothers and my mother im the eldest i was emotionally parentified by my mother who couldnt deal with the pain and anxiety of raising children so young and losing herself and doing that with a man with so many problems himself my father was violent distant controlling bullying etc constantly needing my emotional support since i was i realized that this is fucked up when i was and started to notice and address my problems after such an upbringing while being supportive of both of my brothers who ended up in suicidal depression for a while and in addition dealt with my mom who almost died and was in a coma for a while i had a few longterm relationships until now where i never wanted to move in with another person cause ive never had enough personal space myself the relationship im in now started years ago we moved in together and that led to suicidal depression at the end of the first year so i managed to crawl out somehow but to realize my adolescent years were all in a depressive haze and i never managed to truly find myself and be myself and fully enjoy life as a young person or as a child now after the baby i feel so alone so tired and so failed finally theres a family i would like to take care of because i want to this time its my own son and i love him so much but ive been stuck taking care of my otherfamily and now im just so wasted mentally and physically if im home im anxious and dont have any personal space and nothing to do just for myself when im at work i fucking hate everybody there cause i didnt have the time to get the hell out of there which is financially almost impossible now i loose connection with my mainly single friends who i despise now in a way and i fucking hate everybody else on the streets traffic and anyone who wants to interact with me with the kid i see my previous family a lot aswell which is so tiring i have a small rented room for myself for which i dont have any time to go to or if im there i just cry and watch the clock to get back in time to deal with baby chores so i feel stuck in the same demonic mental state like with my previous family adding the love and responsibility for my child which makes it impossible to say grow up im out of here my woman is in a similar burnout state so not much support from there its the oppisite i feel i should be the one to support her and i can see how devastating it is for her when i break down which causes in turn so much blame for myself all of which drains me of the little energy i have left so now im in full suicidal mode again and not able to do any of these things mentioned and no time to do anything i known i need to do for myself to be sane which makes me think why bother at all anymore on top of that im ill aswell atm so a total wreck i just needed to get it out i dont know if its the best sub for this but anybody else been there,2,0.604592,0.17792669,0.21748123,0.604592
i feel like i have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously f this is long and i feel like im attention seeking for even writing this but its how i feel i could never actually do anything but im tired and dont know what else to do everyone in my life seems to think that just because they dont see me crying im not depressed but when i do end up opening up and crying they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that i feel horrible for even trying to express anything in result i usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best thankfully somedays im numb and cant feel anything at all my mom who i love dearly feels that because i dont pay any bills and dont go to work theres absolutely no reason why i should be depressed which makes sense i guess but my brain apparently doesnt agree lol i zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble im weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and i hate myself for it im occupying valuable space in their class and for what i feel like ill never get caught up i just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that theyll leave me alone a thought that ill most likely never act on every time i look at my work i get incredibly nervous and cant think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me my mom is disappointed in me and no matter what i do or say she doesnt believe me and i end up giving up in the end because i feel like nothing i look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years i feel like i try so hard but theres no evidence to support it i really wish i could do more but i cant i try to force myself but i cant get much done and i dont know why im a terrible student dumb useless and cant complete work on time ive had no motivation for my work or anything else like washing my hair or getting out of bed completely disgusting i know i also have no friends normally people exaggerate and say they have no friends but at least have one or two i have none no one to talk to or confide in ive never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety no one cares no ones ever cared i struggle completely alone and have for seven years ive lost interest in everything i used to love and it hurts so much i think about killing myself almost everyday but im a coward and would never do it ive asked in the past about seeing a therapist covid makes the process even harder but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said fine but shed have to pick up extra shifts to afford it and that she didnt understand why i couldnt just talk to her because were close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues i know she was just frustrated but its statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something so that i wouldnt have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment it wont be until i finally do something actually harmful physical and visible my current self harm which i dont do often isnt that i might get help if i can even be helped but i wont and probably never will i feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time a complete failure and although i try to be as selfless as i can i appear and feel like a selfish ungrateful brat i dont have a bad life and my parents are great so why do i feel this way there have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better but i kid myself every time each year it somehow gets worst i dont really want to die but hate my entire existence and want to get away also i know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny im sorry for bothering you all i didnt know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent thank you if you decided to read this edit im typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this thank you all for being kind and giving me advice im eternally grateful i feel less alone now it felt really nice to finally vent im staying strong and am not going to let depression win i thought about deleting this but if it helps someone ill leave it up,2,0.5689673,0.17465498,0.2563777,0.5689673

handling my family im a fifteen yr old male and my older brother yr was recently diagnosed with autism he is high functioning but has a lot of social issues ive had to rearrange my entire life to cater to his needs now and its difficult and for some reason whenever we argue like all siblings do or i argue with my mom they always make me out to be the villain in every situation heres an example weve recently decided to rewatch the entire mci timeline of movies because we enjoy them almost every five minutes my brother will point out very minuscule details at first i had no problem with it but when we got to the iron man movies it went from five minutes to every ten seconds constantly ohhh thats that iron man suit number or is it the other oneohhhh let me check and is constantly talking all the other small details that dont really matter at the moment cause were just trying to watch a movie and hes just rambling so i pause the movie and ask him to stop he says and ok and then just keeps going this happens around to more times before i snap telling him to just be quiet and watch the movie and then my mother stepped in heres context earlier when we were watching a different mcu movie my mother was very confused about the plotstory so i said hey mom can you put down your phone for this scene it explains everything she nods and watches the rest of the movie joyfully and laughing now lets get back to when she stepped in between me and my brother later she agrees that he needs to settle down but then im immediately bombarded with her trying to make me the villain and then asks whats so important that youre looking at youre phone during the movie in a sarcastic and i replied just looking at my phone why are you mad at me about it you did it earlier and then she snapped now defending my brother in previous arguments she tends to be very minuscule with details and i always have a retort because most of the time shes just angry and doesnt know what shes talking about and then flips the fact that i rebutted into me being the bad guy in every situation it gets worse because shes a hypocrite about it when i get annoyed and snappy and go down to the same amount of detail that she uses when she argues she gets mad at me except when shes the one doing the nit picking and using the small details in her mind it is somehow justified and i shouldnt be annoyed at her it seems like a mental trap that im always the villain in these situations any advice on how to handle this stress i need it edit now that i have left the room because my mother didnt feel like continuing the movie because i somehow ruined it she said she was going to sleep that was a lie because she is now joyfully chatting with my brother i almost feel like my family is happier without me maybe im the problem,2,0.62220806,0.16566065,0.21213129,0.62220806

my life is a mess and i dont think itd be worth the time to clean it up im new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far i apologize for the lengthy post my depression started late in my sixth grade year it began with subtle thoughts of self harm and lengthy sessions of negative thinking by the end of the school year my family moved to the out skirts of a small town bordering the state of washington once we settled in my mother forced me to ride out the last few weeks of school my first day at the new school felt unwelcoming most people generally ignored me and the few that didnt were very manipulative using the fact that i was new to bolster their reputation by the time that summer vacation rolled around my only friend invited me to stay at his house for the majority of the break most of the things that plagued my mind faded into obscurity only coming back during long nights nearing the end of my stay my friend decided to show me his grandfathers stash of firearms with the supervision of his grandfather later that night i had developed a plan to use one of the guns to end it all but never came to fruition due to leaving the next day the rest of the summer flew by leading into the next school year i was still relatively new to the school so i was still in the same circumstances i was last year a new element that was introduced was a lack of interest and work ethic which lead to my grades plummeting late november i was met with extreme fatigue that would last throughout the day resulting in me sleeping through the majority of my classes this would continue to the next school year i still hadnt made any friends only interacting with others when i had to during lunch breaks i usually sat alone sometimes being bothered by groups of the popular kids to get me to say something to satisfy their curiosity and boredom or a concerned teacher or staff member the end of the year my grades hung around failing and barely passing resulting in me going to summer school this summer was uneventful besides summer school my friend didnt make any attempts to reach out to talk to me so i just laid around stewing in my thoughts in the isolation of my room th grade was like th grade only differing slightly my period of isolation during the summer had left stricken with disturbing thoughts paranoia and anxiety during group activities i struggled with speaking to others finding myself stammering when trying to speak at a normal rate and spoke quietly i became embarrassed and would intentionally push myself away from projects later in the year one of the annoying kids became excessively irritating and decided to wake me as i slept during science class i broke my silence and started to berate him this left a lasting impression with some of my classmates after that day i started to focus on my anger as time went on our fights became long winded and increasingly aggressive not long after i got physical with him after he had confronted me outside of class he said something that i took offense to so i grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him against the lockers after that event he gradually stopped speaking around me and skipped the last day once he had heard that i was going to fight him the summer was the same as last year summer school was as helpful as ever and my only friend not making any attempts to speak with me i again left to my thoughts of constant anger and depression my freshman year began slightly different i had developed a friendship with a girl that rode the bus with me she was also dealing with depression due to her abusive and controlling mother my depression dramatically increased in late november when i developed a crush on a girl from my neighborhood i became self destructive insulting my appearance and intelligence i came home in a bad mood all the time either in a blinding rage or in tears i convinced myself that i wasnt good enough for her and that nobody cared about me that i was worthless a week before christmas break i had come up with a new plan to kill myself the last week before christmas break was unbearable the thought of suicide weighed heavily on my mind thoughts constantly screaming at me throughout the day the last day before break during first period i broke down in tears i went to my councilor and confessed that i was going to kill myself after christmas day i was then taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with depression i the spent about a week and a half in the hospital and was released early due to good behavior some acting good attendance to activities and the fact that christmas was coming i left being prescribed zoloft and felt relatively normal for once in a long while christmas break came to an end not long after and school felt very much different in mid to late january i began getting migraines from taking zoloft and was shortly changed to fluoxetine not long after i then started to prepare for valentines day a couple of days before valentines day my friend and i went to get some flowers for my crush i had made plans with my crush to meet up but she missed it and rearranged for the th we met up that night and i confessed my feelings to her to the best of my ability she told me that she didnt feel the same way and friend zoned me we havent spoken since i broke down in tears later that night spiraling back down into my depression i would find out sometime later that she never had any feelings for me and was already in a relationship before my confession covid would soon come around to cut the school year short and brought a new wave of anxiety and fear on top of my failed attempt at a relationship around mid may i stopped taking my medication thinking that i didnt need it any longer june through august made a great amount of progress on myself i began the next school year happier than the last and put effort into my work this would last until november i quickly fell back into my old habits constantly degrading myself in late november i found out how my sisters truly felt about me they felt nothing but hate for me doing nothing but insult my appearance and intelligence and the fact that had no friends to their knowledge in december my fights with my sister got worse and now my mother started to side with my sisters and said that ive changed for the worst that i wasnt her son wishing for the old me to come back she than grounded me and took all of my possessions she would threaten me with the hospital and would threaten to call the cops if i didnt comply this would continue throughout january and end in early february after that happened i began looking for friends so i had someone to relate to by march i had found a couple of people that gave me purpose to live again they helped me find a job and gave me someone to talk to when a felt like nothing in april i started working and hanging out with my friends more often by may it all fell apart i had gotten angry at work from being overwhelmed and two of my friends were working with me that day they thought that i was satan himself and started to spread rumors about me as a result i lost all of my friends and almost lost my job since then ive kept my job but have started to inflict pain upon myself from cuts to burns ive apologized to everyone since but i still hate myself for everything ive felt worse ever since then and have been struggling with my battle against depression once again i hope that i can get some advice or at least get some comfort so i can try to get back on track,2,0.5125707,0.20256504,0.28486428,0.5125707
