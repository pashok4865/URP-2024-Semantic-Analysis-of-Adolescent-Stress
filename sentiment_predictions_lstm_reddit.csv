stress during specific classes im taking online classes just lake a majority of the population right now and i have classes i am taking we do a and b scheduling but one specific class stresses me out so much and im really confused as to why this is happening its not like the class assignments are a lot we get a fair amount of work but not a lot but every time im in that class or go to do the work for that class my heart beats so fast to the point where i feel like its going to come out of my chest and my breathing gets all heavy and i get a stomach and head ache and it takes a bit for me to calm down i have not been diagnosed with any sort of anxiety nor am i going to self diagnose but it has really become a burden because it takes me half an hour or so to calm myself down on top of that the class requires cameras to be on and dont mind it but i will literally be in so much panic and i have to pretend im fine on camera because of obvious reasons i just got out of said class while typing this out and im still on edge and my hands are shaking i just hope this can stop soon because this is a class i cant get out of doing until next school yearif anyone has any tips or advise i would greatly appreciate it,0,0.45761552,0.45761552,0.2927619,0.24962255
bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide posting some ramblings here because i feel alone its long and i apologise for the length dont know where to start but currently im in airbnbs using what little savings i have trying not to think about commiting suicide i used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing i could do it whenever i was ready and when i realized how calm that made me i decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice i live in the desert in arizona but i grew up in california ive always felt alone and suicidal since a child i was raised by my grandparents as far back as i can remember after my mother left to az after my half brother was born years later my half sister was born there after my grandparents passed when i was i had to move to az ive learned growing up i was around dangerous settings and car accidents in infancy and im worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way on top of the regular stuff my grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment i never told them these feelings because i wanted to be a perfect son for them in exchange for what they did for me my grandpa was an old school cowboy type traditional conservativebut never once told me i had to be any certain way as you can probably tell polar opposite here in azi have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like yes no photos anyways i was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in ca but hes been out for a few years already somehow and my mother and step father are convinced im a murderous sociopath thats going to kill them all one day randomly my step father choked me and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because i make them feel uneasy stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me leading to my airbnb situation most days at home i kept to myself in my room but in october i went back to california for weeks when my depression was hitting its peak to see if i had hope or needed closure or something i went back to my hometown and didnt feel any pain i was happy for once i was with my girlfriend who i wanted to take to prom back in ca before i had to move and it feels like ever since i left my life was in limbo i want to go back to live with her but i need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment and its extremely difficult however she told me shes been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well its honestly the only reason i havent done it yet but deep down i feel like this wont work out i have this sense of abandonment so i default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood ive told myself over and over no one really cares about you and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships but whats really making me finally want to go through with it is that i did gig work so ive been getting stimulus and the pua so basically money to just sit around doing nothing i was living at home with my mother so i saved all the money i have the title to my car nothing crazy no debt no student loans and a credit score i was always the chubby kid but since covid ive lost weight like pounds smoking weed and drinking water i can get girls i lost my virginity and im still absolutely depressed and suicidal i even put off losing weight for so long because i was so scared if i got in shape and hooked up with women wasnt immediately happy no im actually feeling worse because now what i know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression but i lost that weight paid off my car reduced my debts etc the next goal would be to have my own home but thats just adding time to the clock like i did with my weight problem all of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and i should just isolate myself or die i have no family when i was living with my grandparents until no one ever came to visit or help and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood i dont know aunties cousins uncles or any of that that abandonment feeling was heightened because of this because my grandparents to me my real parents were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying it reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationshipfriendship i have no one really cares i feel like no matter what life will not get better and i wont be happy just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy i dont want to live for decades this way and id much rather die at peace not to mention how in my lifetime id be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isnt even appreciative of being alive one other thing is holding me back is that im perfectly healthy and wish i could give all my organs away i know they have to be on ice but i was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature but my kidneys could help save a childs life so it feels like a waste and insult im also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment i was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there with age my thoughts of suicide went from i hate myself and want to die to i feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if i was never born i dont keep ammo with me because now i feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon i get some ammo im going on that drive,0,0.497107,0.497107,0.26116574,0.24172729

initiated a fun conversation with a stranger and overcame a fitness fear im feeling really good as im writing this i am genuinely proud of how i handled myself these past two days in two separate situations trying to get over a bit of a slump so i forced myself to go on more walks around the city and parks to hit steps every day its been a really fun atmosphere around the city this weekend because we have the arts festival and pride celebrations both going on in pittsburgh right now yesterday i saw a cute girl sitting by herself and after reminding myself regret is worse than rejection i went over and started a conversation with her the chat was entertaining easy light we learned a bit about eachother and got to have a simple pleasant conversation with hundreds of people walking around the park near us this was the first time ive approached a girl to talk since my year relationship ended when she and i had to head our separate ways to get to work after about minutes i scribbled my number down on a piece of paper and gave it to her its been well over a day now and she hasnt contacted me and at this point im guessing probably wont but thats okay im still incredibly happy that i proved to myself i can still engage in a conversation with a stranger and have the confidence to go start a chat and handle myself throughout please dont interpret this as a silver lining sort of thing because its completely fine if we never talk again im happy about the fact i shut up all those negative worried voices and just walked up to someone and said hi thats a win for me then this afternoon i was feeling really good after my workout and had just got my new running shoes in the mail that morning so i wanted to go for a short run to try them out ive always been self conscious about my weird abb genetics mine dont line up nicely across from one another and i have some light remnants of bacne from when i was a teenager now its degrees full sun in the city right now so i rode that happiness i was still feeling from the previous day lathered up in sunscreen and went for my first run ever without my shirt on i ran along the water and ended up at point park and then walked home to recover through the arts festival and into the city while i was walking home some guy in a white truck was yelling hey buddy buddy buddy buddy out of his window until i turned to look at him in case i something had fallen out of my pocket or he was needing directions at which point he shouted put a shirt on and drove off i smiled so hard and ive felt amazing since then that would have destroyed me like hearing chicken legs when i was a ball boy for the soccer team at but now it was the best compliment i could have gotten this jealous turd was so uncomfortable with where he is at physically that he felt the need to get my attention and try to shame me i felt wonderful i know i have my flaws but i also know i look pretty decent and it was really validating again this isnt something bad where im seeing the silver lining but a genuine sign that ive really grown and can handle that with the knowledge that i look good and im doing well it realllllllly also showed me the truth of that notion that if youve already had a success of some sort early in your day hardships later sluff off more easily i knew i already crushed chest and calves that morning and had a good run so i could take this on the cheek all in all its also been a fantastic example that happiness can compound and you can use each little nugget to fuel you on to do something else im going to keep going and try to work on getting that every day cheers,0,0.46523932,0.46523932,0.25741097,0.2773497

life doesnt get better unless you take actions to make it better but depression itself can make it impossible to act exercisephysical activity eating healthy spending time in nature finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to be good for your mental health but by definition depression is a problem precisely because it inhibits your inability to function much less do things that are good for you finding a therapist trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctorpsychiatrist every few weeks or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more or not even work all takes so much fucking effort that i cant bother to do any of it i went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life and i just didnt know how to tell them that is exactly the problem i have utterly no will to do any of that and thats why im sitting in your office right now and i dont know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way if people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves we wouldnt need to classify it as an illness or disorder thats why its so infuriating when we see how even professional mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which i cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation its so irrational and frustrating that im physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk but i have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever but then i just get sad and start spiralling from guilt and i cant stop thinking about how irrational it is even though ive experienced it for so many years im constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence as if i ever expected anything different more than hopelessness i just feel confused as to what im supposed to do when i cant will myself to do anything what even is this anymore edit thank you for all the comments i didnt expect to get any response its hard to describe but i feel very moved that there are people out there that i reached in a small way for a short moment of time,1,0.45832786,0.2241338,0.45832786,0.31753838

finals week bit of a rant just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same excuse the word vomit ive been up since am for an exam its finals week and anxietystress is at an all time consistent high on top of that our family puppy has been great but i think my school anxiety has trickled in to me worrying over him more than i should and i constantly get overwhelmed with all the things i have to get done i cant even enjoy food because i am always thinking too much and get caught up in the stress of school i literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping and i immediately said wow hes depressed isnt he when hes just sleeping i went out to get food totally fine no problem as soon as i got home it hit me again with all the stuff i have to do the pandemic has affected my mental health especially recently where i dont get any enjoyment of stuff at home because i am always in front of a damn computer screen i used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school and now i see home as the place where i do everything and theres no distinction between relaxing and school but the one thing i can hold onto is that it is going to pass all of this is going to pass at some point the brain is just rewiring itself because of the situation happening globally its going to be okay the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time if this spoke to anyone out there feel free to let me know how youre feeling how are you coping and if theres any puppy pros in the crowd please let me know what you did to help release some of that feeling of wanting constantly to helicopter over them during times of stress when i feel relieved i dont feel any need to check on him constantly or obsess over little things around the house just when i am overwhelmed and then i dont get anything productive done anyways i always remind myself i am not alone and neither are you even talking to strangers about it can be soothing in a way just a little reminder that theres someone else out there in your boat during such a difficult time my counselor said to normalize what is normal during an abnormal time period and also dont forget to tell your pets you love them,0,0.48216763,0.48216763,0.282828,0.2350043

im my girlfriend was murdered the trial is soon and im getting more and more depressive hi yall well im not used to posting on forums but i feel so bad atm and i cant open up about this to my family my friends or my therapist even if they want that i feel completely unable to talk about it with them im a yo man im irish but my family moved to france when i was and that is where i have lived since i grew up in a small country village the school had only two classes i hardly spoke french but i got a friend very quickly ill call her honey in this post so honey and i were friends all our childhood we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school year after year i became bilingual in french and made lots of friends but i started to have a crush on her when i was we started middle school we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together but we were pretty shy at that time so we didnt dare to flirt finally it was the following year when i was years old that we got in relationship ofc the feelings i had for her werent as strong as those i had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but i was so happy she was the first girl i kissed the only one actually we kept growing up we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together if i explain that its so that you understand that from my to years i almost spent every day of my life with her she gradually became as essential as breathing for me the more the years went by the more serious important to each of us our relationship became we never argue ofc sometimes we didnt agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other then when i was we started high school at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple because at that age its unusual but we loved each other so much and i still love her so much it was like i had found the perfect person to me and i dont want to speak for her but i felt like i was perfect to her we kept growing up we did our first time together and all the others i never had sex with another girl we wrote long love letters to each other any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other i mean im kinda that clich of the chunk rugby player people dont really imagine me doing that yet for her id have done anything and everything she was so exceptional i felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life we graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment then started university i was so glad to live with her to sleep with her every night of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasnt the same it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy when i explained to my new mates from the university that i had been with my girlfriend for years they were stunned they asked me if i had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no since my childhood i grew up alongside this exceptional girl and i always dreamed of being with her and i felt so lucky to be in a relationship with i never even noticed any other girl i found her perfect in every way we were so happy i just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was she was so heart warmed she couldnt stand injustice she always wanted to help others she was so kind and caring whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call she was full of wisdom and good intentions she was always smiling she illuminated peoples lives with her presence she was a very funny person as well she always saw the bright side of everything she was so positive she never gave up she worked hard to reach her goals she was so clever id even say brilliant she was a very gifted student she was passionate when she did something she put her whole heart into it she made people feeling special she knew how to bring out the best in them she always complimented everyone she was adorable she was also sensitive she hated seeing the ugly things of the world she could cry for that but she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence ive never met someone so selfless and altruistic she was also incredibly beautiful the most beautiful woman ive ever seen she was an angel for her friends for her family for me for my family who loved her too my mam has three sons and she was used to say that honey was like her daughter my little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me she spent so much time helping him because of her he really took control of his life again everyone loved her literally she was wonderful she was someone who loved to pamper people she could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her i think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive i felt so good with her she was the love of my life literally i always wondered how she could love me so much i mean im not that bad and i always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me and yet she still looked at me like i was one of the wonder of the world we were so happy i was only years old and yet i saw my life with her and she saw her life with me we had lots of plans and even beyond me she was a great person who was so young and had her life ahead of her i mean if we had broken up itd have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing living shining as she deserved but i cannot bear what happened we were together so happy and in love i never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way no one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you someone you love so much its extremely harsh it was a sunday and we were at our parents for the weekend sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together on saturday evening we slept each on our own her at her parents and me at mine there wasnt even a particular reason on sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but i was lazy i was tired i wanted to stay in bed an hour more its absurd i was studying sports science and i was too lazy to go running id never forgive myself its an ongoing case so im not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesnt have to be but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died and then her body was burned suspects were arrested a few weeks later it was in feb and the trial was supposed to be in may but it was postponed because of the coronavirus france is in quarantine i cannot even describe the infinite pain i felt when a few days after his disappearance while very important research was being carried out her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her i had a blackout since i woke up from this fading away i have been taking heavy psychotropes that doesnt prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep otherwise i have awful nightmares i never thought ill fall so low one day i have always been someone very happy and fullblown but i never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either i havent been going to university since i dont do anything except think about her all day i saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit how am i supposed to accept the sudden death of the person i love the most in the world and with whom i grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together they tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions i have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this i feel even worse since i know who did this and what their reasons were because they were people i knew i feel devastated sometimes i want to kill myself and sometimes i want to avenge her by killing them but i feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents who are very friends with honeys parents they had been friends for a long time before because we are neighbors and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened i can see that they have the fear is that i kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of honey her parents are suffering so much they lost their only daughter and i dont know what to do to relieve their pain whenever i speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden they say that honey kept living through me but imo its not true she no longer lives and will never lives again and i miss her so so much but i know if they say that its because they miss her so much too she is missed by everyone who knew her she was so wonderful and i will always miss her people tell me that one day when ill be happy again and ill meet someone else and go back to normal life but i know its wrong first ill never be happy again how am i supposed to live without her after growing up with her she was as essential to me as breathing its unbearable to survive since shes no longer there how can i resume a normal life and how can i meet someone else i never wanted when i was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isnt now that im desperate without her that ill want to meet someone plus she is irreplaceable i feel devastated she is the only one i want and yet i know shell never come back i constantly think of her of her laughter her smile her scent i bought her perfume and i spray it on my pillow every day i know its stupid but its the only thing that helps me sleep a little better i just wanna hug her again sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least im relieved that honey knew how much i loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away because i told her every day just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity as i no longer go to class in rugby or to see my friends i dont see anyone and i had not seen some people for several months they were dazed by my appearance and i hadnt realized but actually i became the shadow of myself i always was very strong and now im extremely bony it depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me thats why i avoid my friends they dont know what to say and i understand thats normal in their place i wouldnt know what to say either and theyre also embarrassed not to know what to tell me the only person i used to open up to is honey and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful my family is trying to support me as much as they can but its very hard there was a very bad atmosphere at home so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to ireland with my older brother i feel like my mom and little brother dont know what to do with me anymore but i dont know what to do with me either i think that after the trial ill go to ireland for a while as well just to take a break here every time i go out everyone is aware of what happened throughout the region and even outside but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more im not afraid of the judgement i know theyll have a long sentence but im very afraid of the trial in itself and to during a week or two to hear what she has been through in detail all day to see her murderers and to hear what theyre going to say im anxious i cannot bear it for the moment im trying not to think about it i spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger we spent all our time there when we were teenagers and our parents didnt want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night everything remained as its when im there i feel calmer i feel like nothing can ever ease my pain i dont even know why i came to tell my story here i just needed to open up and i cant do it with my loved one i dont think anyone will have read this

im my girlfriend was murdered the trial is soon and im getting more and more depressive hi yall well im not used to posting on forums but i feel so bad atm and i cant open up about this to my family my friends or my therapist even if they want that i feel completely unable to talk about it with them im a yo man im irish but my family moved to france when i was and that is where i have lived since i grew up in a small country village the school had only two classes i hardly spoke french but i got a friend very quickly ill call her honey in this post so honey and i were friends all our childhood we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school year after year i became bilingual in french and made lots of friends but i started to have a crush on her when i was we started middle school we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together but we were pretty shy at that time so we didnt dare to flirt finally it was the following year when i was years old that we got in relationship ofc the feelings i had for her werent as strong as those i had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but i was so happy she was the first girl i kissed the only one actually we kept growing up we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together if i explain that its so that you understand that from my to years i almost spent every day of my life with her she gradually became as essential as breathing for me the more the years went by the more serious important to each of us our relationship became we never argue ofc sometimes we didnt agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other then when i was we started high school at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple because at that age its unusual but we loved each other so much and i still love her so much it was like i had found the perfect person to me and i dont want to speak for her but i felt like i was perfect to her we kept growing up we did our first time together and all the others i never had sex with another girl we wrote long love letters to each other any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other i mean im kinda that clich of the chunk rugby player people dont really imagine me doing that yet for her id have done anything and everything she was so exceptional i felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life we graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment then started university i was so glad to live with her to sleep with her every night of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasnt the same it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy when i explained to my new mates from the university that i had been with my girlfriend for years they were stunned they asked me if i had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no since my childhood i grew up alongside this exceptional girl and i always dreamed of being with her and i felt so lucky to be in a relationship with i never even noticed any other girl i found her perfect in every way we were so happy i just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was she was so heart warmed she couldnt stand injustice she always wanted to help others she was so kind and caring whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call she was full of wisdom and good intentions she was always smiling she illuminated peoples lives with her presence she was a very funny person as well she always saw the bright side of everything she was so positive she never gave up she worked hard to reach her goals she was so clever id even say brilliant she was a very gifted student she was passionate when she did something she put her whole heart into it she made people feeling special she knew how to bring out the best in them she always complimented everyone she was adorable she was also sensitive she hated seeing the ugly things of the world she could cry for that but she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence ive never met someone so selfless and altruistic she was also incredibly beautiful the most beautiful woman ive ever seen she was an angel for her friends for her family for me for my family who loved her too my mam has three sons and she was used to say that honey was like her daughter my little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me she spent so much time helping him because of her he really took control of his life again everyone loved her literally she was wonderful she was someone who loved to pamper people she could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her i think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive i felt so good with her she was the love of my life literally i always wondered how she could love me so much i mean im not that bad and i always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me and yet she still looked at me like i was one of the wonder of the world we were so happy i was only years old and yet i saw my life with her and she saw her life with me we had lots of plans and even beyond me she was a great person who was so young and had her life ahead of her i mean if we had broken up itd have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing living shining as she deserved but i cannot bear what happened we were together so happy and in love i never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way no one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you someone you love so much its extremely harsh it was a sunday and we were at our parents for the weekend sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together on saturday evening we slept each on our own her at her parents and me at mine there wasnt even a particular reason on sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but i was lazy i was tired i wanted to stay in bed an hour more its absurd i was studying sports science and i was too lazy to go running id never forgive myself its an ongoing case so im not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesnt have to be but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died and then her body was burned suspects were arrested a few weeks later it was in feb and the trial was supposed to be in may but it was postponed because of the coronavirus france is in quarantine i cannot even describe the infinite pain i felt when a few days after his disappearance while very important research was being carried out her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her i had a blackout since i woke up from this fading away i have been taking heavy psychotropes that doesnt prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep otherwise i have awful nightmares i never thought ill fall so low one day i have always been someone very happy and fullblown but i never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either i havent been going to university since i dont do anything except think about her all day i saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit how am i supposed to accept the sudden death of the person i love the most in the world and with whom i grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together they tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions i have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this i feel even worse since i know who did this and what their reasons were because they were people i knew i feel devastated sometimes i want to kill myself and sometimes i want to avenge her by killing them but i feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents who are very friends with honeys parents they had been friends for a long time before because we are neighbors and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened i can see that they have the fear is that i kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of honey her parents are suffering so much they lost their only daughter and i dont know what to do to relieve their pain whenever i speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden they say that honey kept living through me but imo its not true she no longer lives and will never lives again and i miss her so so much but i know if they say that its because they miss her so much too she is missed by everyone who knew her she was so wonderful and i will always miss her people tell me that one day when ill be happy again and ill meet someone else and go back to normal life but i know its wrong first ill never be happy again how am i supposed to live without her after growing up with her she was as essential to me as breathing its unbearable to survive since shes no longer there how can i resume a normal life and how can i meet someone else i never wanted when i was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isnt now that im desperate without her that ill want to meet someone plus she is irreplaceable i feel devastated she is the only one i want and yet i know shell never come back i constantly think of her of her laughter her smile her scent i bought her perfume and i spray it on my pillow every day i know its stupid but its the only

finals week bit of a rant just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same excuse the word vomit ive been up since am for an exam its finals week and anxietystress is at an all time consistent high on top of that our family puppy has been great but i think my school anxiety has trickled in to me worrying over him more than i should and i constantly get overwhelmed with all the things i have to get done i cant even enjoy food because i am always thinking too much and get caught up in the stress of school i literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping and i immediately said wow hes depressed isnt he when hes just sleeping i went out to get food totally fine no problem as soon as i got home it hit me again with all the stuff i have to do the pandemic has affected my mental health especially recently where i dont get any enjoyment of stuff at home because i am always in front of a damn computer screen i used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school and now i see home as the place where i do everything and theres no distinction between relaxing and school but the one thing i can hold onto is that it is going to pass all of this is going to pass at some point the brain is just rewiring itself because of the situation happening globally its going to be okay the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time if this spoke to anyone out there feel free to let me know how youre feeling how are you coping and if theres any puppy pros in the crowd please let me know what you did to help release some of that feeling of wanting constantly to helicopter over them during times of stress when i feel relieved i dont feel any need to check on him constantly or obsess over little things around the house just when i am overwhelmed and then i dont get anything productive done anyways i always remind myself i am not alone and neither are you even talking to strangers about it can be soothing in a way just a little reminder that theres someone else out there in your boat during such a difficult time my counselor said to normalize what is normal during an abnormal time period and also dont forget to tell your pets you love them,0,0.48216763,0.48216763,0.282828,0.2350043

collecting pieces of my shattered porcelain soul ive been meaning to make a personal post for a while its been a difficult time for me and ive really been struggling lately sitting at my terminal typing this out im finding my words and sentences difficult to conceive perhaps this is an unsurprising reveal an antithesis of the otherwise happy mask i don the mask that says that im okay this is unlike my time earlier this year from my situation with whom we shall call lt and i would be doing myself a grave injustice if i were to have specified it as such the root of my current status quo is complex and unending not simply onedimensional but a great web of connected overlapping and intertwined vertices no to contemplate and dwell on the sources of my pain is not why i started writing this post its not why i had if youre reading this decided to publicize it on the internet expressing myself and delivering my most blatant clear and real cry for help was my reason to be blunt ive lost a lot of motivation and will lately ive lost friends family and most importantly ive lost myself i know that on the surface anyone would be envious of my life im a wellrespected straighta student whos involved everywhere both academically and nonacademically with my foot in the door all across the hemisphere and connections all across the globe with dozens of open job offers and opportunities to ditch my life and move away and make six figures doing what i love and loving what i do with this and that and so much more and more and more and more i make people laugh and i make people smile i make people feel happiness when they havent in a while and i stay with them and i help them and im there for them because thats what i do i help people i look like someone who has everything figured out and i guess i do have a lot figured out im a star student a valued and highlycontributing member of everything im a part of and im amazing at my job and i exceed at everything i do i guess i have a lot figured out but i dont have everything figured out to say that ive lost my friends family and myself may be confusing to an outside observer who sees friends and family still loving me and surrounding me and myself still putting on a smile sustained throughout every shared moment bringing laughter and light and happiness to every room im in perhaps this is nitpicking the specifics of the english language but theyre wrong my friends and family still have me and they havent lost me i said i lost them i said i lost myself anyone whos ever felt this and i know theres a nonzero number of individuals who have who do understands what the subtle but important difference is we understand how its possible for ourselves to lose the people we love and the people we care about without them losing us because its not a matter of possession company relationship or otherwise its about identity there arent words for me to describe it there arent words for me to explain it to someone whos never felt it before ive been writing this for hours already and words are so so difficult to come across ive lost everyone and myself this life that i live this life riddled with clinical anxiety depression ptsd and a physical disability is not a life for the faint of heart i walk through hallways every single day not fully accepting that i am me i look into the mirror and see another person this life is not a life that you want to live so please do not be envious of it im so utterly stressed i love all the clubs and organizations im a part of and i easily excel at both work and school but its exhausting when i have so much emotional baggage to carry on my shoulders my ptsds never gotten better my soul is not a golden model it is one of porcelain dropped and shattered and crushed into a trillion minuscule pieces scattered by the winds of time i truly live two worlds one of false happiness and laughter and love and one of the deserted land in which my consciousness wanders a barren wasteland devoid of life myself never truly able to be me eternally wondering struggling and falling this isnt something ive only recently begun feeling but something ive always felt only repressed and not allowed to surface for so long im in so much pain and i dont want to be in pain anymore impale me with a steel hook and savagely tear my heart out ill never function like you i cant be normal i cant be happy thats been me,0,0.49396834,0.49396834,0.2602974,0.24573421

how to be happy instead of miserable when you become millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal but few define what happiness means often leading us to chase what our parents friends and role models defined as happiness so when we are back to wearing diapers we realize we ignored everything we genuinely esteemed in my experience studying dozens of happiness frameworks and sciencebacked studies about happiness ive found the best chance at being happy at any time comes from defining what happiness isnt its like an inverse happiness checklist in it you write what doesnt bring you joy and then ensure your current pursuit of happiness whether it is to travel the world or become wealthy doesnt include any of the items from the checklist the inverse checklist serves two purposes it helps define happiness and tells you which activities to remove from your life so for example if you conclude money doesnt bring joy but you work from because hustle is life then reduce the number of say side projects you have otherwise youll be frustrated after reaching financial freedom and likely feel physically and mentally exhausted each persons definition of happiness varies however most people can include specific items into their inverse checklist to define happiness your definition of happiness cannot reject distress we cant control the decisions and behaviors of humans animals or nature otherwise hurricanes and phone thieves wouldnt exist so no matter the statistical formula you use to predict events or the number of possible scenarios you draw on your whiteboard potential sources of unhappiness are always around the corner to avoid the discomfort from harmful events some people write a list of sources of distress and eliminate them from their life for example they quit their job to run from their nerveracking boss or switch majors the issue with this list is its potential sizeits infinite because any event in our lives can distress us a more efficient solution is to invite distress into your life and realizing happiness can coexist with events that dont match our definition of a perfect activity day or life for example a harmless event like microsoft word crashing before letting you save an article could either ruin your day or it could become a fun challenge to overcome when you welcome distress you experience two benefits first you become used to different causes of discomfort reducing their chances of affecting you second you realize distress can and must coexist with happiness your definition of happiness cannot come from others most of us chase a definition of happiness that other people set for us leading to repentance during our deathbed for example some people accumulate academic titles to impress their parents while others seek minimalism according to a monks advice in college psychologists doctors and nurses taught me around of older people under palliative care regretted their lives choices but you dont need wrinkles or to be in a hospital to regret your life so instead change it today first write down a list of scenarios that would bring happiness to your life you can then describe the benefits of each scenario and the barriers between you and them second answer the most crucial question whos someone in my life who believes this scenario would bring happiness ask yourself one last question is this goal worth pursuing even though x person shares it contrast your answer with other items from your checklist so if you think happiness is living amongst your friends in the countryside goal your friends feel the same influence but your inverse checklist says you dont like being away from the city then stop pursuing that goal avoid being miserable on your deathbed while your dna differs from the millions of people who have regretted their lifes choices on their deathbeds you may be following another persons definition of happinessjust like they did unfortunately the old and sick dont have the strength to change their lives drastically but you do so start developing today a definition of happiness your elderly self will accept one you truly believe share one item you would add to your inverse happiness checklist below if you are not comfortable doing it publicly please dm me on twitter at mrnicolasforero im curious to discover what you would add,0,0.508967,0.508967,0.24428262,0.24675043

stress during specific classes im taking online classes just lake a majority of the population right now and i have classes i am taking we do a and b scheduling but one specific class stresses me out so much and im really confused as to why this is happening its not like the class assignments are a lot we get a fair amount of work but not a lot but every time im in that class or go to do the work for that class my heart beats so fast to the point where i feel like its going to come out of my chest and my breathing gets all heavy and i get a stomach and head ache and it takes a bit for me to calm down i have not been diagnosed with any sort of anxiety nor am i going to self diagnose but it has really become a burden because it takes me half an hour or so to calm myself down on top of that the class requires cameras to be on and dont mind it but i will literally be in so much panic and i have to pretend im fine on camera because of obvious reasons i just got out of said class while typing this out and im still on edge and my hands are shaking i just hope this can stop soon because this is a class i cant get out of doing until next school yearif anyone has any tips or advise i would greatly appreciate it,0,0.45761552,0.45761552,0.2927619,0.24962255
collecting pieces of my shattered porcelain soul ive been meaning to make a personal post for a while its been a difficult time for me and ive really been struggling lately sitting at my terminal typing this out im finding my words and sentences difficult to conceive perhaps this is an unsurprising reveal an antithesis of the otherwise happy mask i don the mask that says that im okay this is unlike my time earlier this year from my situation with whom we shall call lt and i would be doing myself a grave injustice if i were to have specified it as such the root of my current status quo is complex and unending not simply onedimensional but a great web of connected overlapping and intertwined vertices no to contemplate and dwell on the sources of my pain is not why i started writing this post its not why i had if youre reading this decided to publicize it on the internet expressing myself and delivering my most blatant clear and real cry for help was my reason to be blunt ive lost a lot of motivation and will lately ive lost friends family and most importantly ive lost myself i know that on the surface anyone would be envious of my life im a wellrespected straighta student whos involved everywhere both academically and nonacademically with my foot in the door all across the hemisphere and connections all across the globe with dozens of open job offers and opportunities to ditch my life and move away and make six figures doing what i love and loving what i do with this and that and so much more and more and more and more i make people laugh and i make people smile i make people feel happiness when they havent in a while and i stay with them and i help them and im there for them because thats what i do i help people i look like someone who has everything figured out and i guess i do have a lot figured out im a star student a valued and highlycontributing member of everything im a part of and im amazing at my job and i exceed at everything i do i guess i have a lot figured out but i dont have everything figured out to say that ive lost my friends family and myself may be confusing to an outside observer who sees friends and family still loving me and surrounding me and myself still putting on a smile sustained throughout every shared moment bringing laughter and light and happiness to every room im in perhaps this is nitpicking the specifics of the english language but theyre wrong my friends and family still have me and they havent lost me i said i lost them i said i lost myself anyone whos ever felt this and i know theres a nonzero number of individuals who have who do understands what the subtle but important difference is we understand how its possible for ourselves to lose the people we love and the people we care about without them losing us because its not a matter of possession company relationship or otherwise its about identity there arent words for me to describe it there arent words for me to explain it to someone whos never felt it before ive been writing this for hours already and words are so so difficult to come across ive lost everyone and myself this life that i live this life riddled with clinical anxiety depression ptsd and a physical disability is not a life for the faint of heart i walk through hallways every single day not fully accepting that i am me i look into the mirror and see another person this life is not a life that you want to live so please do not be envious of it im so utterly stressed i love all the clubs and organizations im a part of and i easily excel at both work and school but its exhausting when i have so much emotional baggage to carry on my shoulders my ptsds never gotten better my soul is not a golden model it is one of porcelain dropped and shattered and crushed into a trillion minuscule pieces scattered by the winds of time i truly live two worlds one of false happiness and laughter and love and one of the deserted land in which my consciousness wanders a barren wasteland devoid of life myself never truly able to be me eternally wondering struggling and falling this isnt something ive only recently begun feeling but something ive always felt only repressed and not allowed to surface for so long im in so much pain and i dont want to be in pain anymore impale me with a steel hook and savagely tear my heart out ill never function like you i cant be normal i cant be happy thats been me,0,0.49396834,0.49396834,0.2602974,0.24573421

what should i do about chronic stress hi im years old and kind of accepting that ive got chronic stress issues im not sure how to deal with it exactly and its been months i remember seeing a doctor a while ago and talked about what caused my stressbreakdown last semester and he said it was acute stress i didnt really know what that meant at the time but overall i felt like it was an unhelpful experience because all of his advice exercise things like that and wisdom didnt really help me or i knew would not work because i had already tried i even tried antidepressants because i thought it could have been something i needed but that did not help id say for the past years of my life ive done a great job at handling acute stress that was the only type of stress i knew chronic stress however is something that i dont understand its new to me and requires a greater amount of life changes and mental perspective it feels inhuman almost to have chronic stress it is admittedly frustrating because i feel too young for it im at an age where i should continue to develop myself with my hobbies and stuff but instead every day is typically a rollercoaster my ability to concentratefocus has been incredibly diminished and i find the idea of getting back in to school stressful i am an engineering major but if math stresses me out im just not sure if i can keep it in my life on the flip side i want to be doing those things because i liked the challenge the stress is like a token that just keeps flipping and makes things confusing i doubly worry because i start to think i have mental health issues and the fact is that stress can open up mental health issues i find that when the stress gets to a breaking point which has only happened once in my life i shut down and withdraw and make what changes feel necessary instead of opening up in to some sort of mania or whatever but fuck man how am i supposed to know what to expect if it keeps going there are things which cause me stress that i dont think are supposed to cause me that much stress but they simply do because its chronic i guess i dont know if im supposed to push on and work on my problems in the storm or withdraw and bide my time i also seem to suffer from anhedonia an inability to feel pleasure if i isolate myself from anything stressful school work etc it is possible to feel some pleasure albeit a small amount ive been trying to tackle the problem by getting back in to the things that used to give me pleasure weightlifting was a big one and then taking on the more stressful things school and work but the stressful things seem to outdo any pleasure effects what really kills me is that my sleep suffers if i could get hours a night i would be able to push through without worrying but for the past nights ive gotten probably hours of sleep i havent even started school yet and i dont really work that much so now im sitting here typing this post and worrying about stress again i truthfully dont know what to do or what in particular causes my chronic stress i want to live life like normally so i can combat depression and things like that but then the stress keeps me up i am seeing a counselor and hopefully a therapist soon but i am in the early stages of that is this something that can be medicated can you medicate stress away or does it boil down to lifestyle changes ive done a pretty damn good job of having a healthy lifestyle for the past couple years which is another frustrating thing i dont drink smoke but admittedly i think about sex too much and id say that is my vice at the moment it was also a source of stress for me that contributed to this chronic stress in some way that said i dont pursue sex in an unhealthy way but i might be a little more flirty or resort to jackin it to try and fill some sort of void that im missing i eat pretty healthily not a fan of soda or junk food i see food more as calories and less for pleasure other than that i loved weightlifting and for a good while was able to do both cardio and heavy lifting now however i feel like that contributes to my stress a little bit because i know i dont sleep enough to be able to lift weights and recover without it causing too much stress i want to bulk up a bit and get back to more intenseheavier lifting but im not sure if thats even healthy for me in my given state at the same time i get stressed out after a week or two if im not doing that lol again with the flipping a token thing i dont really like being around my friends or people as much when im like this not because i am in a bad mood but because i know i cant simply vibe with them ill be too worried about feeling stressed out to actually enjoy it this is why i think i really like counseling because its just a place for you to go to talk about your problems with someone my only solace has been learning how to play my guitar but thats not what i intend to do with the rest of my life and it doesnt always take the stress away sometimes i just get tired of playing it what are my options im years old live at home with my dad so i dont have much responsibility thankfully ive done quite a bit with my life that im happy about so i feel like i was doing what i wanted so its tough thinking about how to change all the things ive been doing have helped me grow as a person and alleviate that sort of depression you get when youre just not doing anything with yourself but again now when i start doing those things i experience a lot of stress and have to come to a stop thus depression can come back i kind of yearn for when things didnt feel this stressful the first two years of college feel like they could have been ages ago and man i thought that was a challenge because during that time i was just finding myself looking back on it though it was just easy to live in the present and deal with stress as it came not battling it every waking hour i understand things about mindfulness meditation making the right choices etc but man that doesnt explain why i cant get enough sleep,0,0.47189778,0.47189778,0.2773178,0.25078437
bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide posting some ramblings here because i feel alone its long and i apologise for the length dont know where to start but currently im in airbnbs using what little savings i have trying not to think about commiting suicide i used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing i could do it whenever i was ready and when i realized how calm that made me i decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice i live in the desert in arizona but i grew up in california ive always felt alone and suicidal since a child i was raised by my grandparents as far back as i can remember after my mother left to az after my half brother was born years later my half sister was born there after my grandparents passed when i was i had to move to az ive learned growing up i was around dangerous settings and car accidents in infancy and im worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way on top of the regular stuff my grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment i never told them these feelings because i wanted to be a perfect son for them in exchange for what they did for me my grandpa was an old school cowboy type traditional conservativebut never once told me i had to be any certain way as you can probably tell polar opposite here in azi have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like yes no photos anyways i was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in ca but hes been out for a few years already somehow and my mother and step father are convinced im a murderous sociopath thats going to kill them all one day randomly my step father choked me and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because i make them feel uneasy stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me leading to my airbnb situation most days at home i kept to myself in my room but in october i went back to california for weeks when my depression was hitting its peak to see if i had hope or needed closure or something i went back to my hometown and didnt feel any pain i was happy for once i was with my girlfriend who i wanted to take to prom back in ca before i had to move and it feels like ever since i left my life was in limbo i want to go back to live with her but i need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment and its extremely difficult however she told me shes been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well its honestly the only reason i havent done it yet but deep down i feel like this wont work out i have this sense of abandonment so i default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood ive told myself over and over no one really cares about you and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships but whats really making me finally want to go through with it is that i did gig work so ive been getting stimulus and the pua so basically money to just sit around doing nothing i was living at home with my mother so i saved all the money i have the title to my car nothing crazy no debt no student loans and a credit score i was always the chubby kid but since covid ive lost weight like pounds smoking weed and drinking water i can get girls i lost my virginity and im still absolutely depressed and suicidal i even put off losing weight for so long because i was so scared if i got in shape and hooked up with women wasnt immediately happy no im actually feeling worse because now what i know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression but i lost that weight paid off my car reduced my debts etc the next goal would be to have my own home but thats just adding time to the clock like i did with my weight problem all of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and i should just isolate myself or die i have no family when i was living with my grandparents until no one ever came to visit or help and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood i dont know aunties cousins uncles or any of that that abandonment feeling was heightened because of this because my grandparents to me my real parents were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying it reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationshipfriendship i have no one really cares i feel like no matter what life will not get better and i wont be happy just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy i dont want to live for decades this way and id much rather die at peace not to mention how in my lifetime id be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isnt even appreciative of being alive one other thing is holding me back is that im perfectly healthy and wish i could give all my organs away i know they have to be on ice but i was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature but my kidneys could help save a childs life so it feels like a waste and insult im also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment i was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there with age my thoughts of suicide went from i hate myself and want to die to i feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if i was never born i dont keep ammo with me because now i feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon i get some ammo im going on that drive,0,0.497107,0.497107,0.26116574,0.24172729
initiated a fun conversation with a stranger and overcame a fitness fear im feeling really good as im writing this i am genuinely proud of how i handled myself these past two days in two separate situations trying to get over a bit of a slump so i forced myself to go on more walks around the city and parks to hit steps every day its been a really fun atmosphere around the city this weekend because we have the arts festival and pride celebrations both going on in pittsburgh right now yesterday i saw a cute girl sitting by herself and after reminding myself regret is worse than rejection i went over and started a conversation with her the chat was entertaining easy light we learned a bit about eachother and got to have a simple pleasant conversation with hundreds of people walking around the park near us this was the first time ive approached a girl to talk since my year relationship ended when she and i had to head our separate ways to get to work after about minutes i scribbled my number down on a piece of paper and gave it to her its been well over a day now and she hasnt contacted me and at this point im guessing probably wont but thats okay im still incredibly happy that i proved to myself i can still engage in a conversation with a stranger and have the confidence to go start a chat and handle myself throughout please dont interpret this as a silver lining sort of thing because its completely fine if we never talk again im happy about the fact i shut up all those negative worried voices and just walked up to someone and said hi thats a win for me then this afternoon i was feeling really good after my workout and had just got my new running shoes in the mail that morning so i wanted to go for a short run to try them out ive always been self conscious about my weird abb genetics mine dont line up nicely across from one another and i have some light remnants of bacne from when i was a teenager now its degrees full sun in the city right now so i rode that happiness i was still feeling from the previous day lathered up in sunscreen and went for my first run ever without my shirt on i ran along the water and ended up at point park and then walked home to recover through the arts festival and into the city while i was walking home some guy in a white truck was yelling hey buddy buddy buddy buddy out of his window until i turned to look at him in case i something had fallen out of my pocket or he was needing directions at which point he shouted put a shirt on and drove off i smiled so hard and ive felt amazing since then that would have destroyed me like hearing chicken legs when i was a ball boy for the soccer team at but now it was the best compliment i could have gotten this jealous turd was so uncomfortable with where he is at physically that he felt the need to get my attention and try to shame me i felt wonderful i know i have my flaws but i also know i look pretty decent and it was really validating again this isnt something bad where im seeing the silver lining but a genuine sign that ive really grown and can handle that with the knowledge that i look good and im doing well it realllllllly also showed me the truth of that notion that if youve already had a success of some sort early in your day hardships later sluff off more easily i knew i already crushed chest and calves that morning and had a good run so i could take this on the cheek all in all its also been a fantastic example that happiness can compound and you can use each little nugget to fuel you on to do something else im going to keep going and try to work on getting that every day cheers,0,0.46523932,0.46523932,0.25741097,0.2773497

and completely lost ive never posted anything online before so ill try to be succinct im male never married no kids on medical leave from my job for depression im so disappointed in the person ive become no matter how much i read or do its like i have not gained any wisdom on managing lifes challenges i grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations i was an a student through college but my social skills have always been lacking i managed to work for the past years but i couldnt keep up in my current job hence the medical leave ive been in therapy for much of the past years my psychologist believes i have traits of avoidant personality disorder i take several antidepressants and im currently two weeks into tms therapy nothing seems to help im unbelievably critical of myself even now as i write this message i am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on reddit ive been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written im even more amazed by the responses how are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice i read everything i can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained i cant imagine giving advice to someone there is so little i can think of to say to people in distress im a mess right now i have lost hope of getting better i dont exercise i sleep hours a day i have a house but i spend most nights at my parents nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me the worst thing is that my exgirlfriend cheated on me three years ago and i havent dated since i have some solid friends that ive known since high school they are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own i cant seem to learn anything these days i used to be smart but i am not longer able to learn new things i cant imagine surviving another years i think about volunteering but i even tell myself that i have nothing valuable to offer ive no real skills to rely on i have saved about k in my years of work i had saved that money so that i could support having a family some day i no longer think im capable of having a family too overwhelming i would be an awful spouse and father i dont plan to go back to work i plan to just live on my savings as long as i can and then end my life by then my parents will be gone and i wont hurt them my siblings and friends will be hurt in the nearterm but they will be ok in the long run ive read so much on coping with this disease but so little spurs me to action until last year im was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going keeping up with job and social occasions the weed stopped working for me though now if i smoke it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse thanks for reading all this i love you,1,0.5640606,0.18513903,0.5640606,0.2508004
how i overcame my pornography addiction why i started to change my life for the better this is tough for me to talk about but i thought this story will help inspire men growing up as a teenager i had a really bad pornography addiction i used to watch it days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence it made my dating life and sex life horrible i knew i was better than that i could not believe this was taking over my life and how could i let it get this far so one day i was like fuck this i need to get my life together i started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies i tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes it was amazing i met some great friends i started eating healthier i did everything i could to take my mind off it i started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer i even started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography it was a very tough process but i was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after months so the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you what controls your mind controls your life mental toughness,1,0.50145125,0.24381864,0.50145125,0.25473008

school stress hello everyone im currently in my last year of high school and im having a hard time dealing with it i live in eastern europe and in my country we have those big exams at the end of high school that are supposed to evaluate all the knowledge youve gained since grade two exams are mandatory one in literature and the other one you can choose the subject yourself for my second one i chose physics and im pretty confident with that however literature has always been a huge burden on mine and i find it extremely difficult to prepare for that exam i am beyond angered constantly that i have to deal with that subject i do understand that literature increases your knowledge about the world and teaches you how to support your arguments but the emphasis that is given on that exam by my teacher and parents is too big and i cant do anything but hate the guts out of it now me being the perfect student raised by perfectionist parents i cant even think about having low grades on that exam i study in a highly respected school where teachers can be pure evil to you i also have to prepare for my university entrance exams and work on a project of mine which stress me out even more at the end of the day i feel so drained out and like ive achieved nothing even though i have spent the whole day in school and preparing for exams ive started feeling physically unwell i used to work out a lot but now i dont have the energy to go out of my bed my blood pressure is very low and ive gained weight ive given up to emotional eating one too many times i wanna shine for prom i want to look my best at the end of the school year and feel my best when real life hits me but im scared that school will drain me out too much this is more of a rant post because i know the only way to fix the situation is by resting more i just cant let myself rest my mind is constantly busy with my work anyways any help or advice or simple encouragement would be appreciated if you made it that far thank you for taking the time to read about my problems,2,0.4199977,0.20708612,0.3729162,0.4199977

i lost my identity idk how to start this or how long it will take but ill try to summarize everything ive lost my happiness i was a joyful boy always happy always smiling always grateful for everything around me but that was only the surface of it depression took over my life followed by anxiety and emotional numbness affected my life emotionally and mentally to a point of no return i wake up with headaches and sleep with headaches the only mins i feel completely free from anything is the min after i wake up my head is empty light as a feather i literally fight with myself to not remember anything and just enjoy the little amount of peace i have left before my nightmare of a day begins ive lost the ability to be happy over the years due to alot of stuff happening my cousin dying of cancer my first and only gf that i have felt genuinely attached to and btw our relationship comes and goes but i couldnt stay friends with her and see her with other men it hurt me so i chose to just fade away and am not surprised that hasnt tried to contact me or anything but just hurtful my aunt who was my best friend and only friend till the th grade died and it broke me so much the very first girl i liked for years from the th grade to th grade whom i worked on myself to be a good man for her in the future when i approached her she made fun of me and humiliated me and it destroyed me by the high school first year everyone know each other i was lonely i made some friends here and there but still didnt feel anything then i met my ex gf i mentioned earlier and she broke many many times on and off till i broke it of completely and it hurts so much its like a fire burning and eating me alive inside out i tried to shake it off find other hobbies but i didnt i didnt cuz i am not talented i have no hobbies i have nothing that am good at yet i keep smiling to the point where smiling became my hobby i smile in the face of people and laugh at their jokes but thats only because am used to doing it to the point it became like an automatic response a forced and uncomfortable habit my mouth hurts when i smile socializing with my friends when i go out hurts the most all of them are talented and in better colleges than myself i envy them sometimes having great and bright future but then i remember am not as talented as they are my emotional numbness has been increasing lately rapidlyfew months ago my father burned his by mistake i watched as my sister and mother trying to cool his leg and the blood coming out getting creams and first aid i stood there and watched and felt nothing absolutely nothing wondering what the hell is wrong with me at first i thought my depression started when the first girl i liked made fun of me and humiliated me but then i realized i had the depression since i was young maybe because i was alone and had no friends maybe because everytime i force myself to socializing things turn awkward or take a left turn during the pandemic i loved the idea of wearing face masks hiding my face and my emotions was something that made me feel comfortable and confident also wearing a hoodie i was like a ghost walking around not worried about what people think of me i have suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday couple months ago a neighbors daughter was my age yrs old committed suicide threw herself from a th floor hitting her head in the middle of the street at night and i happend to pass by and see her lying on the ground like that feeling absolutely nothing again ive lost the ability to love to talk to socialize to be happy and enjoy life and am not the type of guy who can move on tried to move from my ex but failed miserably so after many many attempts i gave up trying all i am is a walking talking idiot whos smiling and laughing with people forcibly who cant stop himself from doing it cuz if i did ill be giving them blank faces and thats way worse thats why i prefer face mask so no one can jude me idk why am typing this post but the thought of suicide is always on my mind idk if or when i am going to do it but incase i did i wanted to let everyone know my story am scared of myself of what i will become if i let depression anxiety hate anger and negativity take complete control over idk what monster ill be i already did horrific things that am not proud of that i do not wish to speak of but they are bad and pretty fucking messed up whoever i have locked up inside is bottling out slowly getting stronger every day idk how long i can hold it but sooner or later i will have to let him come to the surface and when that happens i dont think ill be able to heal from it in the end am just a constant in a sea of variables mr robot,1,0.6223513,0.13928942,0.6223513,0.23835932

i dont feel like im suicidal enough to warrant help but at the same time every time i do feel suicidal it hits me like a ton of fucking bricks like right now my heart is telling me to go jump off the fire escape the scene keeps replaying in my head while i lie in bed motionless and numb i feel like a fake depressed person because i avoid my responsibilities and just play video games or do anything meaningless to fill time it just makes me feel like a lazy person and i often think im just using my depression as an excuse to feel lazy and that i deserve the suicidal thoughts i want to admit myself to inpatient but again i feel like id just be taking up space as a fake depressed person even though sometimes i really cant stop thinking or fantasizing about killing myself i just dont want to experience the stress of school anymore i lost all my friends im also scared of leaving my partner to fend for themselves and i dont know if my school would even permit a leave of absence anyways also covid of course every time i think about or try to do homework my brain goes into suicide mode even though i love learning and what i learn about im so far behind in my classes because maybe im just lazy and not actually depressed i dont know its not like anyone will see this i just need to talk about it i feel so nauseous small edit i went to sleep last night and am only now checking reddit after class and i im so blown away by the supportive responses and the support offers ive gotten when i said i thought no one would see this i genuinely meant it and so to be able to read everyones comments even the ones of people who are in the same spot it has given me more hope i feel so warm and fuzzy inside i felt i had lost all my friends to my depression and i havent felt this feeling in my chest in a while and i cant overstate how flattered i am i would cry if i could im gonna try to reply to people you all really helped me last night and today i woke up and its a bright sunny day i can hear the cars and the people outside im still sad and unstable but i feel hope in my chest so thank you really whiteheart,1,0.39567792,0.20892115,0.39567792,0.39540094
nobody has ever shown romantic interest in me context i am a year old college student with severe clinical depression and anxiety i have a decent amount of friends and we pretty regularly hang out and go out together my friends say im not an unlikable person i have some hobbies including reading and writing im told im pretty funny and as far as i know my friends and family like having me around however i tend to be more on the introverted side and dont always take to people right away i also dont think im necessarily ugly just not attractive i have a skinny build im etc etc ive gone through two whole decades of my life and not a single person has ever shown a romantic interest in me i have had and currently have plenty of friends who are girls and have never had an issue talking with them so its not like i am someone who never puts themselves out there during quarantine a bunch of friends and i downloaded tinder as a way to talk to people around campus while we stayed shut in our apartmentshomes nothing really came of it but i quickly realized that i wasnt having the same experience as all my other friends they were getting tons of matches and likes and i was only getting a few likesmatches all the conversations i had with matches never seemed to go anywhere despite trying different approaches and even having my friends give me advice when i brought up my lack of likesmatches to my friends they tried overhauling my profile to be more like theirs but there was no change tonight a couple friends and i were hanging out and they were all swiping through tinder and getting matches while discussing their plans with some of these girls to hookuphangout obviously i had nothing to contribute to the conversation and just sat there scrolling through tinder while watching my friend next to me get matches in a row i felt awful im just so tired of it all i wasnt worried in high school about girlsrelationships as i figured id have plenty of chances in college to pursue those things but im coming to realize that people are just not interested in me i feel like ive tried everything and seeing my friends put no effort into any of it and still have so many girls coming to them makes me feel like just giving up im scared because i feel that after i graduate its only going to be that much harder to meet people i guess im just wondering if anyone ishas been in the same boat and if anyone has any advice,1,0.5400881,0.19906966,0.5400881,0.26084223

i honestly cant tell if im depressed or lazy as shit hi everyone using a throwaway to avoid identification as i f write this im on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason before this i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles at dinner i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food this is kinda embarrassing my mum keeps asking me why im always lying down not in a malicious way or anything and i cant really pinpoint the reason but im always unexplainably exhausted the good days are fine and sometimes really good but the bad days like today just really suck i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion i have wasted yet another day for some context im in a transitional period in my life graduated from high school waiting to start college in october ive had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world got accepted to some really good schools etc however for the most part nothing really excites me this is a real low compared to my last years of high school consistent high achiever top student for a bunch of subjects you get the gist during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things i notice that when im not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school i always get like this more intensely than otherwise like during summer vacations another thing every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them ive barely done anything the only things i managed to bring myself to do in the last months were the result of me being talked into them by various people i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go i am tired and ill do it another day i feel like shit because i dont know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that im lazy my head is really heavy as i write this so i apologize for my streamofconsciousness writing style the reason why im so confused is that when i am in social settings im really lively and fun im also a very typical gifted kid overachiever with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit i have a loving family and supportive friends i am grateful for everything i have but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes i dont dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me i dont know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays basically if people arent giving me responsibilities i cant bring myself to do anything im so sorry i dont have the ability to organise this coherently right now but could anyone share what depression can feel like or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic some clarity would be amazing please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem at least i can stop being selfpitying and start doing something about it just a disclaimer i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear dont worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it that was a really long post if you read to the end thank you edit ill be deleting this account soon but before that thank you everyone for the kind words advice and suggestions it means the world to me and im going to try to act on your advice take care of yourselves,1,0.56182915,0.19145934,0.56182915,0.24671152
i regret not committing suicide when i was younger as a teenager i thought about it a lot came close once or twice but i chickened out now i regret it so much if i had done it then only my family would have been affected and its partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them now i have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if i did it they dont deserve it i wish i had done it when i still had so few attachments when there was so little harm to be done now i am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those i love fuck edit thanks to everyone that replied and for the awards i am reading every answer even if i dont reply to all its interesting to find out that so many other people feel the same way i wish us all patience perseverance strength and healing redheart,1,0.5692127,0.18362902,0.5692127,0.24715838

stress vent low key plea for help and advice i have no job at the moment over the summer i started a landscaping company with my partner and things were starting off top notch when the summer ended i was starting school after dropping out after years i dropped out because i had a huge falling out with an extremely close friend of mine i dont want to put too much details on what that falling out was but basically i destroyed his trust in me and not only that i lost literally every friend i had me and him where so close together that when shit hit the fan the other people in our circle stopped talking to me it took me years to recoup my social loss and all the depression i had i had tried to commit suicide but failed after saying goodbye to my friends over the phone they called the police and they came out to speak with me during this time i also started to delete all my social media i deleted my twitter account instagram and partially my facebook i took down all my photos of my face and unfriended all my close friends except family because my only means of communication are thru facebook finally during that summer i started feeling like myself again as if things could turn for the better instead of the worse i chose to go back to school to try and put myself back on a good track in life when i was in school before the events above i was planning on joining the us army as a second lieutenant its been a dream and passion of mine since i was born my parents have pictures of me all over the house in army costumes and huge cardboard boxes that i drew on to look like tanks i felt alive being in that uniform especially in college as i joined the universitys rotc program unfortunately as i grew older my parents health became poorer and poorer my father has crushed discs in his spine as well as diabetes and early onset dementia its mostly he will forget directions to the store and what he did yesterday or hours ago but apparently he will soon forget our names my mom has ms and fibromyalgia on top of ptsd from some trauma she experienced thru her childhood as well as had extensive surgeries in the past both take extremely potent pain killers my dad is the worst with it he literally snorts them like coke and does atleast a day my mom has to control how much he takes but there pain is so severe most days theres no other remedy i can really show them i tried talking them into medical weed but my parents arent interested in the properties and say they wont work from there medical history you can tell they dont have any income except for my oldest brother who is a high functioning autistic adult currently on his masters program at the same school i was attending so financial issues has always been a problem for our family we dont have any other family with us both my moms side and my dads side hate us for some reason so its really just me that they depend on i have another older brother but he moved out and hasnt spoken to any of us in awhile he calls during the holidays but thats really the only contact we have my parents are alwaysalways behind the ball on bills and we have had multiple disconnections from the electric company one time they didnt pay for months straight and the bill totaled on top of reconnection fees so i had to figure out how to pay all of it because my parents had no earthly idea how to come up with the money every month for the past years has been a challenge for money ive worked jobs stolen things sold drugs just to keep us up but its just never enough years ago they had a house they where buying and had went behind on the mortgage for almost months i had no idea because they never told me about it they lost the house and had to move into a rental and who took care of that i did ive been having to care for my sick parents since i graduated high school i had to put my dreams aside because i couldnt just leave for the military they couldnt even last the couple of months i would be gone for training so i put my dreams away to try and hustle and work to bring them out i started looking into ways of making as much money as i possibly can but everytime i make a breakthrough something happens like my car breaking down or something doesnt get covered by insurance and since i stole it had come back to haunt me which of course i expected thankfully i never had to go to court or anything so im having to pay a restitution which is too much a month for me to pay and yes i have been missing those payments i understand the repercussions of those actions but i have to focus my energy on maintaining my apartment which i rent ontop of my parents house which i help pay a portion for as well as the electric and internet as well as dog food for the dogs the gas for me and my dads car a portion of my oldest brothers books as well as other things here and there to keep them afloat and alive i am drowning in debt i went back to school to try and get a business degree this semester but the age old need for assistance from me came back to haunt me and instead of investing my financial aid from college on some business ideas i had to try and make it ended up going to there bills and mine when i realized i spent all my grant and scholarship money on bills and not my textbooks and school stuff i just withdrew no point in going to class unprepared also since its the fall we have had no business for landscaping so weve been short on jobs ive been trying to apply for seasonal work and other jobs but so far its been more of a bust than anything good now im week late on rent for my apartment i have to come up with close to in less than days to pay my rent my bills and my parents rent and bills so im basically beyond fucked i could kill myself but its not gonna solve the problem i just dont know what to do and tbh i just wish i can be someone else right now like delete this saved game and start new lol thats my rant for the day i dont expect anyone to respond to this so if you read this

if my depression spiked during the corona virus is it really depression or is it regular before the corona virus came i was suffering from being emotional numb this was because of things outside the virus but would take to long for me to explain however once the corona virus hit my mental health and self care dropped to the floor for me i was in the th grade the first time the corona virus was brought up and we went on lockdown during does first months as i had my summer break to i played video games constantly with my friends from the uk as that was where i use to live and i was feeling great at the time because any kid at that age would love to not go to school for months but whilst does months were going by i started realizing how unproductive my daily routine was and how bad my social skills were getting by this time i was in the th grade and now we actually had to do online school the only thing is me being in my room for months straight not doing anything but playing games and eating made my numbness way worse at this point i started not caring about life anymore and instead of living it would just feel like im existing in a dead corpse it got so bad that i cheated on every online work i got and i did not feel bad at all and i still dont even when i had to go in person to do my final exams i knew i was gonna fail them but still didnt care now im a freshman in highschool and i honestly cant see myself doing anything but working at a fast food restaurant once i finish school bring abled to make friends has gotten so as to the point where i find it hard to speak to new people online to be honest highschool isnt the worst im glad i get to go in person because its forcing me to speak to people however ive spoke to people about this depression and a lot of people say it is because of covid however i havent seen much people talk about it here in all honesty im hoping that does people are right because ive had this numbness for years now and i dont want it to be something i have to live with forever,1,0.56455004,0.1938706,0.56455004,0.24157941
family pressures im a student been studying towards a goal since the day i left highschool but im not where im supposed to be i dont want to make this longer than it needs to be so my basic question is how does everyone deal with family expectations i keep getting asked the same questions when do you finish uni what are you going to do after what does your degree allow you to do i cant go to a single family event without going through this exact line of questioning to the point where i dont want to see them anymore my father whom i live with is the same i know the direction im interested in but i dont yet know the path and i feel like people speak to me like i should like my life should be planned out already i got tired of it and so i lied a dumb decision i know they think ive finished when i really havent because i got tired of them wondering why of feeling like a failure for now being where i should but now keeping up the lie has made things worse now im expected to be progressing and getting a new job etc when im still where i have been for the last years its been months and ive already been accused of having too much time on my hands despite studying full time and working jobs because they dont know how do you get yourself out of a hole that you dug yourself and how do you do it when youre terrified of the consequences of telling the truth maybe im a coward but i feel lost the one person who knew me most and supported me most i lost halfway through this degree and ever since i feel like i havent been able to cope at all,0,0.36269444,0.36269444,0.34524634,0.29205924
i dont wanna do this anymore im not a big reddit poster but what i have to say id like at least a select people to hear it idk if i can help anybody but if it helps you to know people are going through the same thing ill tell you im going through it im a yo male and used to be the happiest man without a problem in the world it all started when i was about years old i had chronic pain and severe kidney problems i went to multiple doctors searching for a cure or a procedure that would return me to normal none of the doctors i visited seemed very interested in fixing my issue as they did in just prescribing me narcotics i was pretty straight laced and at first wasnt even interested at all in taking these medications i just wanted my problems fixed however the doctors insisted and quite literally talked me into taking these medications that controlled me with script after script coming for the better part or years here i sit now after surgeries and probably close to prescriptions for oxycodone vicodin dilaudid and yes even fentanyl wishing i would have just dealt with the pain and never given in to taking the narcotics even once addiction is such a real thing and it can happen to anyone i hate to say im not at fault for this because im sure some of the blame is on me but this cycle of addiction depression and suicidal thoughts and actions would likely not be there if it wasnt for me being given script after script and forcefed pills since i was a teenager now i buy drugs from the streets just to feel anything and i just wish more than anything that one day i can put this neverending cycle behind me im sorry for the rant guys and thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this for reference this was in the us during probably when so many doctors were getting in trouble with the law for over prescribing opioid medications we hear all over the news about what happens to these doctors and pharmacists but what about the likely hundreds of thousands of lives that were impacted by them getting patients hooked on pain killers forcing them to either go through constant depression pain and withdrawal symptoms which sometimes feel worse than death itself or going out and finding these drugs elsewhere and buying them for their own use this is what led to such a major opiate epidemic in the states and why so many have lost their lives to this painful and seemingly impossible to escape cycle again sorry for the rant i love you guys redheart,1,0.46898007,0.26042885,0.46898007,0.27059108
i disappointed everyone that expected great things from me when i was attending high school i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university particularly mit all my teachers were extremely proud of me my parents were excited for my future in education my peers thought highly of me however once the middle of my junior year came i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression i would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think i eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing at that moment my life lost its meaning near the end of my junior year into senior i stopped taking care of myself developed insomnia due to my obligation to try and keep up with my ap classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering and slept in all my classes my teachers parents and peers as a result started looking down at me wondering why i became such a disappointment according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing i would resort to cutting myself drinking taking old prescription pills and withhold from eating as a way to punish myself to make this short i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music that is my dream everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me i wish it could go away this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment thank you if u actually do read this,1,0.551519,0.20444909,0.551519,0.24403194

meeting a fellow suicidal student in middle school changed my outlook on life you really never know whats going on with someone this is a reminder to just be kind when you can because you dont know whats happening under the surface i was reading a post that reminded me of a certain conversation i had with a fellow student back in th grade i was in a lab group with three other kids and this guy who was insanely smart and always cracking jokes rolls up his sleeves hes got all these scars on them and so another girl in the group asks about them he just casually tells us he has a cutting problem his parents had to confiscate knives and things the rest of the group kind of just was like ok wow thats scary and then we just did the assignment i feel like i missed an opportunity there to help someone out this guy just opened up about something so personal and i sort of just was shocked and confused so i didnt comfort him and i didnt say anything touching or kind back honestly i think i just couldnt process it was he joking for me at least lots of people joked about depression and suicide all the time in middle school it had never occurred to me that some of these people actually felt that way when i think back on the whole interaction i realize i would never have known the internal struggle this guy had even existed if i didnt just happen to be in his lab group and he just happened to roll up his sleeves im also really bothered by the fact that no one was concerned in the group including myself another thing that severely bothers me is the fact that this was middle school i feel like thats so crazy young and the reality that kids were already facing so much pressure and stress forces me to seriously question what the heck is going on in society right now the main thing that this has taught me is that you seriously never know what someone is going through i would never have guessed that this kid hated themselves like that he was so smart i kind of was jealous at times and he made the wittiest jokes and he was always smiling i dont know what has happened to him i think he switched schools the next year or moved or something wherever he is i hope hes doing well and i hope hes found some real support since our school didnt provide it,1,0.47954112,0.2556146,0.47954112,0.2648443

i feel like i have no friends theres a long backstory to part of my feelings around this topic but the basics are that i have a twin and weve always shared everything including friends nearing the end of high school they got really annoyed with this and told me all our friends werent mine because they were friends with them first so i essentially cut off a good five or ten people then i had my one friend who was mine and only mine she got a boyfriend near the end of high school as well though we were still close but i rarely saw her then they broke up two years ago and weve been super close for the past two years until recently she got a new boyfriend and i hardly see her or talk to her anymore my sister who ive always been close with has a long term boyfriend too and im considered the third wheel to their relationship so i dont hang out with them much either one of my friends from high school who i cut off recently got back in touch with me and weve been getting close again but about a month ago she got a new boyfriend and i havent talked to her since another of my friends just moved a hour drive away for school another one just moved to a new continent for a study abroad program for a year i thought my mental health was getting better but with all of this happening i feel like im back to being thirteen years old and not wanting to get out of bed at all,1,0.600939,0.17666216,0.600939,0.22239885

could person just read this its getting harder to pretend im okay and i dont know how to keep it up edit wow thank you so much everybody i am so grateful please please comment on peoples posts that dont have any comments if you can hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you i know this post will be ignored but at least i tried at least i tried to get help from my parents friends school hotlines reddit but nobody wants to help the only person i had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me it really broke my heart into a million pieces because i dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him my parents called me a freak and a weirdo said that i need to snap out of this and get over myself after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when i was idk why i made that yr old me was questionable they got enraged when they saw my self harm at they got really mad the tension in the house and the shame was unbearable i couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room now i act like im fine and happy all the time we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together and its massively improved our relationship im grateful to have parents i now get along with but its only because i hide my mental health lately things have gotten so bad its getting hard for me to hide it from them im forgetting to do things they told me to im losing things they lent to me theyre getting pissed off when i didnt mean to im not doing this on purpose got mad because i didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money of course it came across as rude and i felt so guilty my whole family probably thinks i dont care about them i feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth my friends they all have it bad bad home lives mental health problems every single one of them and im always trying to help them but when i tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse i havent spoken to them in weeks because im so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how i am its hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so i dont talk to them im not okay but theyre not in the right place to help me they need help themselves its getting really hard to socialise i talk to my boyfriend everyday and its just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him i try to cover up how bad im hurting but sometimes i crack he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like i did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy i feel so fucking shit that i cant even get my shit together school is so difficult i log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying mental health matters guys when their school counsellor wont even bother to show up time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me last minute or during class when we cant use our phones or just simply not been there my mental health doesnt fucking matter to the school does it they say its really important we look after our wellbeing so they suggest going out for a walk breathing taking breaths and talking to someone well we already know thats not fucking possible but the other tips are just really basic level things they dont bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists they only tell us how to look after our wellbeing when im doing all those things and its gone beyond that im really doing badly and they dont care they just expect you to get on with it so i get told off for not participating in my live lessons well im sorry that i tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet i got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise i cant fucking do it i cant switch off my mental health for you school there is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated high achieving focused participating just always okay and i cant do it and i know this will transfer into the real world the working world they always expect you to be okay and its not like i want to walk around looking all miserable but its just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time i have a university interview coming up soon i dont know if i can do it im so broken and suicidal that i dont think i can act all enthusiastic and persuade them id be a great passionate hardworking student when i can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed dress myself and eat theres so many signs im struggling and nobody cares if youre lucky they will

broke up with my m ex f exactly a year ago and i still cant seem to cope with the reality and move forwards so im not sure if my story would fit the motif of this sub but i cant seem to find any other places that would help me otherwise hopefully this would be the place my ex and i broke up at the end of august exactly one year ago after being in a relationship for two years we shared the same friend group studied in the same department had affections for each other and what meant to happen happened now i was not a great partner by any mean even though she was everything to me and i blame myself every single day for letting it happen i completely understood her decision for dumping my ass it just hurt so much that even after one year i still cant move forwards the whole shenanigan happened during my senior year and it certainly affected my dissertation work very badly for a few months afterwards i managed to push myself and come to school regularly to work on my thesis i worked in a lab for my thesis statement there were many other issues parts of it due to the fact that i was not into the academic by any means and i had skipped a whole year previously to work part time jobs just because i disliked the subject so much this gap year specifically and the differences in academic motivation were big reasons why she dumped me the other was seeing her and her new partner she found someone else immediately afterwards in the same faculty that we were in on a daily basis and it just hurt my weak ass so much that i would not be able to concentrate at all for the rest of the day so in order to distract myself from the facts mostly i found myself using tinder its kind of a meme where im from hopefully to find a friend a partner of some sorts this was going on for a few months having met a couple of really nice girls before i realized i was no good to them and what i was doing is selfish and unhealthy so better off just to keep the affliction to myself and not put it on other people now moving forwards because of that realization in addition with my suffering in school i decided to quit school entirely hopefully to come back someday quit my part time job not like i was able to work properly anyway and found myself stuck inside for the past months or so i also stopped chatting and seeing my friends all together i share a small friend group of people in college with my ex and thats about it i studied high school abroad so no bff around im a dumbbell at keeping contacts as well she is a regular chatter and i cant put myself in any further emotional pain especially when she suddenly decides to talk about her now partner in our group now im not an outgoing individual and ever since my failure at studying abroad i love medicine and was hoping to continue studying abroad after high school but failed to do so due to financial issues so im back in my country doing the complete opposite of what i like i started to develop a mild condition of depression it came to my exs recognition too but she wanted nothing to deal with it it finally crossed the line after the break up in addition to all the stress i got from school and family i sought a diagnosis earlier this year and was on medication for a few months though having known the conditions of mental health support in my country and the financial situation my family is in i relied on the medication alone and it has not helped just one bit i realize this has been quite a rant and some of you may call me weak which i agree a hundred and ten percents btw i just helplessly felt the need to let this pain off my chest and hopefully get some advices in return but otherwise i truly appreciate your reading and maybe somehow i can manage to get myself together in the near future if not then it was nice knowing you all tldr high school goals shattered due to financial problem back to nam disliked college and the chosen academic found a girl broke up due to differences in academic motivation fell into depression and have been selflocked inside ever since found ways to distract myself but to no avail cut off all contacts and medication is not helping help,1,0.57396996,0.18014348,0.57396996,0.24588652
finals and college applications are feeling like too much im fully aware that every student encounters stress around the time of finals but im completely overwhelmed honestly i feel cheated as well all my other friends in public school are skating by in all their classes talking about how they never have homework how their finals are so easy etc they go out live it up on the weekends and spend time with friends senior year is supposed to be my time to have fun the last chance to be a kid before going off to college im stuck at an insanely rigorous private school that assigns me hours upon hours of homework every night and even more over the weekend finals are cumulative meaning students are responsible for every detail of everything we have learned this year i could understand the reasoning for giving cumulative finals if broad concepts were being tested however its not just broad concepts its every date and every battle about which we have learned in history its every problem we have done in math and the same for every other subject it is all an unbelievable amount of material being required and i do not truly feel like i can manage it to make matters worse i am currently right on the line between letter grades doing well on my finals will pull me up and doing poorly will keep me down i would not normally be so stressed about finals but they are a kind of make it or break it thing at this point especially because certain colleges require my first semester transcript i just finished applying to the honors program at the college i will most likely be attending but i have been so swamped with work all the rest of my life that im not even sure i even want to embark on something else challenging i hear college is the place you make all your true friends find yourself and everything else like that i just fail to even comprehend this idea because all school has ever posed is stress it feels like all my life has ever posed is stress anyone who survived a rigorous and stressful high school experience please tell me im going to make it i expect the best of myself and hate myself when i cant deliver i lose my head when i get too stressed and i dont even feel like i know what im doing anymore,1,0.56393045,0.20235303,0.56393045,0.23371647

can someone read this its my full story if i can have at least one person read this it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life im a black m in highschool who lives in the usa my interests fall in computer science math video games and animemanga when i was younger i loved video games so much and i still do to this day video games were the reason i was planning to work at a game development studio in the future i felt more understood by vgs than i did with my family im not close with my family and i dont ever will be because they are toxic af ive been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story they are the major cause for my depression and some for my suicidal tendencies as more time passed i would stay in my room as much as i can because i whenever i would step out my parents would drag with them to some store usually insult me or whine about how lazy i am my mom has been more abusive but at the same time she is an idiot who i was able fool on a few occasions my dad is annoying and racist for some ungodly reason he hates white people which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father my stepmom is stupid and racist so i cant stand her certainly least my sister is a literal bitch who has no regard for anyones feelings school is the worst thing to have ever happened to me i dont even know where to begin with school because i have had so much shitty stuff happen to me elementary school was ok i was easy target for harassment but its not as bad as it was in middle school when i was in elementary school i never saw the importance of school i barely did any work and never bothered to pay attention in class almost everyday in elementary school i just looked forward to going home and playing on my nintendo ds it was my major motivation back then then came middle school this is where so many problems came to rise words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was this is when school pressure really started hitting me and that i felt the need to work harder i had only like one friend in the beginning of grade and by then i began getting bullied by having that friend this friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student but i defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so i can keep being his friend one day at the end of the year my science teacher decided to expose me in front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work i dont blame her though lol next is th grade where there was no end to bullying throughout the school year i tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot i would do the most retarted shit just for attention because i felt so lonely worst idea ever now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me i asked i crush out and she rejected me wasnt much a big deal but i did feel pretty embarrassed after almost all my friends were fake and would easily turn their back on me whenever i was alone thoughts of self harm would become more frequent and whenever i wasnt i was being harassed by someone the last day of th grade is literally the worst day of my life completely lonely the first half then midday i accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete and it ruined the clothes i was wearing that day my friend saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can almost immediately when he found out he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb i looked with chalk on my clothes students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion i was so suicidal that day next is th grade not as terrible as th but still bad i was admitted into a th grade biology class because of my great grades in th grade environmental science but the biology class was horrible to be in the teacher was absolute shit and made it harder for us just for the sake of it when i came in that class on the first day i almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and i knew none of them some of the other students i sat with hated me because i got some of the concepts confusing insert some more embarrassing moments then you have th grade high school is better then middle school but i still hate school in general th grade ive never been so lonely th grade my existential crisis began th grade suicide attempts burnout and more suicide attempts i dont want to treat life as a separate entity but killed me this year i wish i can just take a mental break but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit if i cant even do it well in high school then how can i do it college life is so horrible i get abused for the most minor things and i dont know what to do anymore i have no idea what to do for the future because i ruined my grades and ive overthought what i want to be when i grow up i attempted suicide like over times this year but none of them work i dont understand why people just wont help me even when i reach out i wish my life just ended by whatever means i dont to be homeless especially at this because its insanely cold outside my point is everything is just not fucking fair i actively try do the most i can to rid depression and do my schoolwork but nobody will fucking cooperate with me even when im having my best

parentified parent with severe depression im a male and at this point id be glad if someone or something would take my life it all went rapidly downhill after i got my first child who is a wonderful little boy now so similarly vital and full of life and energy like i was when i was little everybody used to go jesus christ the energy on that boy i mean everybody now i feel dead for a long time and next to the current situation i feel even worse i was physically parentified by my father fulfilling his beliefs and standards and taking care of his needs when he was terminally ill with leukemia for years he held me responsible for him and as a buffer between my brothers and my mother im the eldest i was emotionally parentified by my mother who couldnt deal with the pain and anxiety of raising children so young and losing herself and doing that with a man with so many problems himself my father was violent distant controlling bullying etc constantly needing my emotional support since i was i realized that this is fucked up when i was and started to notice and address my problems after such an upbringing while being supportive of both of my brothers who ended up in suicidal depression for a while and in addition dealt with my mom who almost died and was in a coma for a while i had a few longterm relationships until now where i never wanted to move in with another person cause ive never had enough personal space myself the relationship im in now started years ago we moved in together and that led to suicidal depression at the end of the first year so i managed to crawl out somehow but to realize my adolescent years were all in a depressive haze and i never managed to truly find myself and be myself and fully enjoy life as a young person or as a child now after the baby i feel so alone so tired and so failed finally theres a family i would like to take care of because i want to this time its my own son and i love him so much but ive been stuck taking care of my otherfamily and now im just so wasted mentally and physically if im home im anxious and dont have any personal space and nothing to do just for myself when im at work i fucking hate everybody there cause i didnt have the time to get the hell out of there which is financially almost impossible now i loose connection with my mainly single friends who i despise now in a way and i fucking hate everybody else on the streets traffic and anyone who wants to interact with me with the kid i see my previous family a lot aswell which is so tiring i have a small rented room for myself for which i dont have any time to go to or if im there i just cry and watch the clock to get back in time to deal with baby chores so i feel stuck in the same demonic mental state like with my previous family adding the love and responsibility for my child which makes it impossible to say grow up im out of here my woman is in a similar burnout state so not much support from there its the oppisite i feel i should be the one to support her and i can see how devastating it is for her when i break down which causes in turn so much blame for myself all of which drains me of the little energy i have left so now im in full suicidal mode again and not able to do any of these things mentioned and no time to do anything i known i need to do for myself to be sane which makes me think why bother at all anymore on top of that im ill aswell atm so a total wreck i just needed to get it out i dont know if its the best sub for this but anybody else been there,2,0.604592,0.17792669,0.21748123,0.604592
life is a chore having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of i have to do this all over again have to go to school college university or even work were stuck in our imaginative sociable unsociable life there are no questions to our daily duties as were following the propaganda of what others expect us to be just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species we all supposedly have a purpose to fill but what if you dont fit that category where do we go from there in my situation i personally think i am not fit for this world i suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health similarly my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything i have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation i lost the one person i loved deeply and now she is with someone else theres nothing and no one left to live for i hate going to sleep at every night knowing ill wake up again doing the same thing over i hate waking up every morning with this heavy chest pain i hate life and i wish i could give up and end everything,1,0.48753878,0.25503847,0.48753878,0.2574228
i feel like i have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously f this is long and i feel like im attention seeking for even writing this but its how i feel i could never actually do anything but im tired and dont know what else to do everyone in my life seems to think that just because they dont see me crying im not depressed but when i do end up opening up and crying they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that i feel horrible for even trying to express anything in result i usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best thankfully somedays im numb and cant feel anything at all my mom who i love dearly feels that because i dont pay any bills and dont go to work theres absolutely no reason why i should be depressed which makes sense i guess but my brain apparently doesnt agree lol i zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble im weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and i hate myself for it im occupying valuable space in their class and for what i feel like ill never get caught up i just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that theyll leave me alone a thought that ill most likely never act on every time i look at my work i get incredibly nervous and cant think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me my mom is disappointed in me and no matter what i do or say she doesnt believe me and i end up giving up in the end because i feel like nothing i look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years i feel like i try so hard but theres no evidence to support it i really wish i could do more but i cant i try to force myself but i cant get much done and i dont know why im a terrible student dumb useless and cant complete work on time ive had no motivation for my work or anything else like washing my hair or getting out of bed completely disgusting i know i also have no friends normally people exaggerate and say they have no friends but at least have one or two i have none no one to talk to or confide in ive never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety no one cares no ones ever cared i struggle completely alone and have for seven years ive lost interest in everything i used to love and it hurts so much i think about killing myself almost everyday but im a coward and would never do it ive asked in the past about seeing a therapist covid makes the process even harder but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said fine but shed have to pick up extra shifts to afford it and that she didnt understand why i couldnt just talk to her because were close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues i know she was just frustrated but its statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something so that i wouldnt have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment it wont be until i finally do something actually harmful physical and visible my current self harm which i dont do often isnt that i might get help if i can even be helped but i wont and probably never will i feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time a complete failure and although i try to be as selfless as i can i appear and feel like a selfish ungrateful brat i dont have a bad life and my parents are great so why do i feel this way there have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better but i kid myself every time each year it somehow gets worst i dont really want to die but hate my entire existence and want to get away also i know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny im sorry for bothering you all i didnt know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent thank you if you decided to read this edit im typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this thank you all for being kind and giving me advice im eternally grateful i feel less alone now it felt really nice to finally vent im staying strong and am not going to let depression win i thought about deleting this but if it helps someone ill leave it up,2,0.5689673,0.17465498,0.2563777,0.5689673

handling my family im a fifteen yr old male and my older brother yr was recently diagnosed with autism he is high functioning but has a lot of social issues ive had to rearrange my entire life to cater to his needs now and its difficult and for some reason whenever we argue like all siblings do or i argue with my mom they always make me out to be the villain in every situation heres an example weve recently decided to rewatch the entire mci timeline of movies because we enjoy them almost every five minutes my brother will point out very minuscule details at first i had no problem with it but when we got to the iron man movies it went from five minutes to every ten seconds constantly ohhh thats that iron man suit number or is it the other oneohhhh let me check and is constantly talking all the other small details that dont really matter at the moment cause were just trying to watch a movie and hes just rambling so i pause the movie and ask him to stop he says and ok and then just keeps going this happens around to more times before i snap telling him to just be quiet and watch the movie and then my mother stepped in heres context earlier when we were watching a different mcu movie my mother was very confused about the plotstory so i said hey mom can you put down your phone for this scene it explains everything she nods and watches the rest of the movie joyfully and laughing now lets get back to when she stepped in between me and my brother later she agrees that he needs to settle down but then im immediately bombarded with her trying to make me the villain and then asks whats so important that youre looking at youre phone during the movie in a sarcastic and i replied just looking at my phone why are you mad at me about it you did it earlier and then she snapped now defending my brother in previous arguments she tends to be very minuscule with details and i always have a retort because most of the time shes just angry and doesnt know what shes talking about and then flips the fact that i rebutted into me being the bad guy in every situation it gets worse because shes a hypocrite about it when i get annoyed and snappy and go down to the same amount of detail that she uses when she argues she gets mad at me except when shes the one doing the nit picking and using the small details in her mind it is somehow justified and i shouldnt be annoyed at her it seems like a mental trap that im always the villain in these situations any advice on how to handle this stress i need it edit now that i have left the room because my mother didnt feel like continuing the movie because i somehow ruined it she said she was going to sleep that was a lie because she is now joyfully chatting with my brother i almost feel like my family is happier without me maybe im the problem,2,0.62220806,0.16566065,0.21213129,0.62220806

ive been depressed since i was and its all because of my parents ever since i was a little kid my parents were always toxic and they havent really changed much i was never really allowed to have friends or get too close to anyone for the purpose that people are bad which i understand now that people are bad but i feel like the lost sheep and i cant even socialize and im ive had depression and depersonalization and anxiety for as long as i can think of to this day i still do and this is no way of living i try to have a good relationship with my parents but then i remember all the past times and the feelings resurface they would always threaten me that if i had fights at school that they would kick me out but in reality people were the ones starting things with me i had no one to express myself to and my family only made fun of me and told me i was lying i told them i had a condition called trichotillomania and they denied it and said that im lying i would fill in my eyebrows with makeup because i wanted to hide the spots from where i pulled my hair out in return i got made fun of and told that i look stupid instead of providing me with professional help of course when i have all these outbursts its because ive lived my life in humiliation and grief and never did someone offer to help me through the darkest period of my life i feel like ive been living in hell they have bullied me so much in my life that i cant even function like a mentally stable person and i cant do anything about it because they buy me food and pay for my things so i will be seen as ungrateful and then i will be blamed again now i wont say that ive been a perfect child either but growing up i was surrounded by bad and abusive people so i became stubborn and sometimes got into trouble but i was only young and was expected to act like i know everything which is impossible and a good parent would be better at teaching their child but why expect your child to be perfect when your child lives around parents who fight all the damn time and hit each other but i cant take it anymore and i cant continue ignoring the fact that ive had a horrible past and its the reason why my mental health is so bad i cant even make it through the first month of college without wanting to give up because of how hard everything is and no one even fucking listens they all just have high expectations of you and not having self esteem or friends or confidence just makes everything worse shouldve just offed myself a long time ago cause theres no recovery from this illness ever its gonna be a long road of misery,1,0.40783668,0.32682997,0.40783668,0.26533338

my life is a mess and i dont think itd be worth the time to clean it up im new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far i apologize for the lengthy post my depression started late in my sixth grade year it began with subtle thoughts of self harm and lengthy sessions of negative thinking by the end of the school year my family moved to the out skirts of a small town bordering the state of washington once we settled in my mother forced me to ride out the last few weeks of school my first day at the new school felt unwelcoming most people generally ignored me and the few that didnt were very manipulative using the fact that i was new to bolster their reputation by the time that summer vacation rolled around my only friend invited me to stay at his house for the majority of the break most of the things that plagued my mind faded into obscurity only coming back during long nights nearing the end of my stay my friend decided to show me his grandfathers stash of firearms with the supervision of his grandfather later that night i had developed a plan to use one of the guns to end it all but never came to fruition due to leaving the next day the rest of the summer flew by leading into the next school year i was still relatively new to the school so i was still in the same circumstances i was last year a new element that was introduced was a lack of interest and work ethic which lead to my grades plummeting late november i was met with extreme fatigue that would last throughout the day resulting in me sleeping through the majority of my classes this would continue to the next school year i still hadnt made any friends only interacting with others when i had to during lunch breaks i usually sat alone sometimes being bothered by groups of the popular kids to get me to say something to satisfy their curiosity and boredom or a concerned teacher or staff member the end of the year my grades hung around failing and barely passing resulting in me going to summer school this summer was uneventful besides summer school my friend didnt make any attempts to reach out to talk to me so i just laid around stewing in my thoughts in the isolation of my room th grade was like th grade only differing slightly my period of isolation during the summer had left stricken with disturbing thoughts paranoia and anxiety during group activities i struggled with speaking to others finding myself stammering when trying to speak at a normal rate and spoke quietly i became embarrassed and would intentionally push myself away from projects later in the year one of the annoying kids became excessively irritating and decided to wake me as i slept during science class i broke my silence and started to berate him this left a lasting impression with some of my classmates after that day i started to focus on my anger as time went on our fights became long winded and increasingly aggressive not long after i got physical with him after he had confronted me outside of class he said something that i took offense to so i grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him against the lockers after that event he gradually stopped speaking around me and skipped the last day once he had heard that i was going to fight him the summer was the same as last year summer school was as helpful as ever and my only friend not making any attempts to speak with me i again left to my thoughts of constant anger and depression my freshman year began slightly different i had developed a friendship with a girl that rode the bus with me she was also dealing with depression due to her abusive and controlling mother my depression dramatically increased in late november when i developed a crush on a girl from my neighborhood i became self destructive insulting my appearance and intelligence i came home in a bad mood all the time either in a blinding rage or in tears i convinced myself that i wasnt good enough for her and that nobody cared about me that i was worthless a week before christmas break i had come up with a new plan to kill myself the last week before christmas break was unbearable the thought of suicide weighed heavily on my mind thoughts constantly screaming at me throughout the day the last day before break during first period i broke down in tears i went to my councilor and confessed that i was going to kill myself after christmas day i was then taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with depression i the spent about a week and a half in the hospital and was released early due to good behavior some acting good attendance to activities and the fact that christmas was coming i left being prescribed zoloft and felt relatively normal for once in a long while christmas break came to an end not long after and school felt very much different in mid to late january i began getting migraines from taking zoloft and was shortly changed to fluoxetine not long after i then started to prepare for valentines day a couple of days before valentines day my friend and i went to get some flowers for my crush i had made plans with my crush to meet up but she missed it and rearranged for the th we met up that night and i confessed my feelings to her to the best of my ability she told me that she didnt feel the same way and friend zoned me we havent spoken since i broke down in tears later that night spiraling back down into my depression i would find out sometime later that she never had any feelings for me and was already in a relationship before my confession covid would soon come around to cut the school year short and brought a new wave of anxiety and fear on top of my failed attempt at a relationship around mid may i stopped taking my medication thinking that i didnt need it any longer june through august made a great amount of progress on myself i began the next school year happier than the last and put effort into my work this would last until november i quickly fell back into my old habits constantly degrading myself in late november i found out how my sisters truly felt about me they felt nothing but hate for me doing nothing but insult my appearance and intelligence and the fact that had no friends to their knowledge in december my fights with my sister got worse and now my mother started to side with my sisters and said that ive changed for the worst that i wasnt her son wishing for the old me to come back she than grounded me and took all of my possessions she would threaten me with the hospital and would threaten to call the cops if i didnt comply this would continue throughout january and end in early february after that happened i began looking for friends so i had someone to relate to by march i had found a couple of people that gave me purpose to live again they helped me find a job and gave me someone to talk to when a felt like nothing in april i started working and hanging out with my friends more often by may it all fell apart i had gotten angry at work from being overwhelmed and two of my friends were working with me that day they thought that i was satan himself and started to spread rumors about me as a result i lost all of my friends and almost lost my job since then ive kept my job but have started to inflict pain upon myself from cuts to burns ive apologized to everyone since but i still hate myself for everything ive felt worse ever since then and have been struggling with my battle against depression once again i hope that i can get some advice or at least get some comfort so i can try to get back on track,2,0.5125707,0.20256504,0.28486428,0.5125707
